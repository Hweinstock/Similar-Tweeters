I still support laww for it
no
Quite a bit under it
!standards
Srsly stop with the weird sex shit
He didn't get curb stomped by Whitebeard because Whitebeard didn't really fight him
He *did* get curbstomped by Roger
lmao
not very hard no
Ehh I doubt it
he still calls himself the mightest power
she was yeh, not an apprentice tho
She was there
That's about it lol
Yeh maybe
Might've even done him a favor later on to help him grow to power
Yeh, but 20 years later and marco's only a commander
while Kaido's the strongest thing walking the earth
...or flying, or swimming
Presumably he's just under the crew in general
Nah, they're perfect
New chap link guys ^
Nicer translation for sure
Thanks to juba for this one ‚ù§Ô∏è

<@!415999229564157955> Well that was Queen saying it, so should it be foddery?

I meant this bit
Which one were you talkin about?
Oooh, I was looking and totally skipped over that
Oh yeh, you're right
Another Emperor
<:CrocoKid:487633532907159552>
Boy how about that One Piece
This sounds like a whole lot of <#164970986284777473> talk
In fact, let's move it to <#164970986284777473>
!modlogs 508883871119572992
Yes we do
His fruit generates clouds
That's why most of the time he's flying around, presumably, he's got a full sky of them
Yep, it makes clouds
^
Yes, Kaido creates clouds
Goddamn lmao
Yeh juba, Big Mom does it with Zeus and Prometheus flying around together
Wilhelm, she already has
Big Mom making a storm seems to be a signature thing for her
Kaido does make clouds, and he does use them to fly
Reportedly the same way as Momonosuke
But, Oda hasn't really displayed it that way yet
No, those are his clouds
They are clouds yeh
Hang on

lmao
I'm sure they'll be able to use it for a good hour or so
Given that they're doing this specifically with the intent to die for it
I have no doubt they'll try to keep going while the other minks fall out
Kaido's never done lightning, but he does do clouds
His first appearance, he blanketed the sky over
Just like the natural byproduct?
Yeh probably
Especially since it seems to be storming already outside of Onigashima
It does
We see that happen with Roger and Whitebeard
they cause a storm on their island basically

In series confirmation about Kaido basically being able to coat the whole sky in clouds
Potentially, but I can also see Kaido just letting them change too
Turn them back
The form is only active if you're looking around during a full moon
It's the light that does it
so they just close their eyes and they're fine

Oda's knocked it out of the park with these, archer
all arc
It's snowing, godzilla
That's their gamble, blix
Having said that, this is still an Emperor known for being basically a juggernaut

Can we ban this guy? Maybe it's just me, but I see nothing but these kinds of weird ass shitposty messages, and half the time he derails a convo doing it
!modlogs 282705264862560257
!ban 282705264862560257 Degenerate behavior and constant derailing of conversations with weird sexual remarks or general shitposting
üëçüèæ
<@!277922292556890112> Sorry, but we only allow english here. There's a french server in <#357665389859307520> though
üëçüèæ
Course he hasn't, that's why he had to stop and focus when he helped yamato
But, I can see him being proficient in it for now
Given that he had been trying to learn this for 2 years and just only now got a teacher to help him do it
!ban 277922292556890112 Non-english speaker
Who tf is Marco gonna betray?
Well, that is what he declared he was going to end up doing
so it's either that or Marco's chasing him
Lmao, no goddammit
<@!274366418223497217> The mark thing, YEEESSSSSS. So fucking hyped. I love that every single thing he reads just gets better and better
Luffy wants to grab Momo, but I imagine we'll see the start of the Big Mom fight by next chapter
I hate that term so much
but it's not wrong
why would their strength matter?
Switching their personalities would make things worse for everyone
As far as we ever saw, it was just his fruit gaben
Though the fandom did assume he used haki as well since Vergo was
No see
the problem is there's still Kaido's body and powers to deal with
And his entire crew is built on power hungry failures trying to climb up
You're basically saying give a nuke to a psycho
Yes, when he uses his Room for too long and runs out of stamina, it starts draining his life instead
But that would be bad tho
Kaido not being in control of his body means someone potentially *worse* than Kaido in control of his body
The only people he could possibly switch with would be a random entirely unaffiliated samurai
Kaido isn't immortal
he *was* invulnerable
Up until he met samurai lmao
Big Mom was born with steel skin
Kaido seems to just be a beefcake, and apparently his fruit helps
We really don't, we just know a good bit
but none of it would affect things like Big Mom or Kaido are
He's not going to lose from ptsd lmao
Lmao, I think red gave up on getting me to read Haikyuu <:LUL:321931602655707136>
I gave it an honest try
They're also not making their skin invincible, nor is it
It's just naturally that way
and Kaido seems to just be powerful, not a skin deep strength
OH I DID NOT
Let me get right on that
good breakfast tunes
UGH I can't believe I forgot
I was so happy getting off of work
Later bud
I'm almost done with Heatwave
20 seconds in and I could tell this was ***fire***
When Whitebeard fought
The *world* was in danger
Yeah, I'd celebrate him dying too
For sure <:KuzanWoke:553336814660878336>
<@!420202273885519872> Just started Dreamland, still lovin it
Whitebeard was also an Emperor, and would've caused *tons* of widespread damage and panic with just about everything he did
Hell, fighting with Roger changed the weather and tore apart an island
No wait, lemme rephrase
*Hitting* Roger did that
One time
I was looking at that one, I used to love that show as a kid too lmao
I just put it on, and I am loving it so far
Oh hell yeah, this is great
It feels like Eminem and the Weeknd did a song with Pharrell and Daft Punk
This is definitely a jam
almost dislocating, not breaking
So I've heard Heatwave, Space Ghost Coast to Coast and Waterfalls Coming Out Your Mouth
100% hit rate so far, lol
Yeh, they always hit it out of the park
There were a couple I liked less on How To Be a Human Being, but I still iked all of that one too
Oh for sure
I still need to listen to that one too,The Strokes new album
He can do it, blueline
Oh dang, I'm hyped for it then
I just got to Melon and the Coconut, I see what you say about the guitar
This album is my new stoner album, I swear hahah
It's so chill but still such an upbeat jam
I just had some raisin bran and a banana
And now, poptart <:ZoroNut:632474447462400010>
Oh yeh, they're really unique with that
Their music is like listening to happy velvet
Gaben, fishman island was a necessity
Elbaf will be a side adventure unless they find some reason to go
mkay
I just got to Tokyo Drifting, it sounds so different but still hits
Usopp wants to go to Elbaf and Luffy has friends there
That is 100% the only reason they need to go
Denzel Curry on this one omg
He hasn't really used *any* technique since then
His only fight since was a quick run through of some fodder and an entirely offscreen bout with the gifters, lol
<@!420202273885519872> So I finished it, and much like totallynotmark, pretty much everything kept getting better as I listened
I'm gonna have to give it another go around in a bit so I can pin down my favorites
<@!372464153480134666> neerrrrrrrdddd
<:CrocoKid:487633532907159552>
Pretty much the same, but I'd replace Dreamland with Heatwave so far
I'll see how I feel after the second one tho
Batchee, now hush
Oh y'know what, Melon instead of Heatwave
Definitely
Because the bug was named and he died
Who could forget Batchee?
<:CrocoKid:487633532907159552>
Milk girl?
From Ace's thing?
I don't remember rofl
That break down was pretty great tho, favorite part of the song lol
It opens like a song from the Eagles, but then the bass hits and it's like
strap me in bb
SHANKS LOLOLO
That'shilarious
Shanks clashed evenly with the two strongest people in the world, pendas
>no showing of power
Clashed evenly
with the two strongest people in the world
lmao
<@!629040165750571038> Yeah, that doesn't happen here. And please reach out if it does, we'll hop right on it
üëçüèæ
Chopper's never lost a fight in Monster Point I'm pretty sure
When has he gotten shit on?
What about him?
Chopper didn't use monster Point against Enel
Oh yeh, Denjiro too lol
!whois 348674121934045185
Fishmen at Fishman Island
Homies and Big Mom at WCI
You're all wrong because Sabaody is the best pre-skip arc <:CrocoKid:487633532907159552>
Top 1
With honorable mention also being Sabaody
Sabaody ft. Sabaody
The best series in the arc
Before Whole Cake, I honestly like WCI the most I think
It's a hard tie
*akshually*
Zou did have skirmishes <:CrocoKid:487633532907159552>
And a small war
One of the biggest tearjerkers for me is actually a happy moment
When Dressrosa is freed and Kyros goes from smiling ear to ear and breaking down and full on ugly crying
Just because of how happy he is
gets me every time
I have something for you kamui
hang on

!modlogs 573258353879547926
<@!573258353879547926> English only pls
Yeh zeph, that's another one that gets me too
Another super happy moment
The Kyros one will still hit me like no other tho
Just the weight of it slamming into him all at once
I gotta get the pages
Oh fuck yeah, when Jinbe signed on in Impel Down to basically die for Luffy I liked him
But what made him nakama to me
Is when he hands Luffy the den den mushi to speak to Bon Clay one more time
This lady used to make really decent One Piece AMV's with some songs I liked
But she was horribly full of herself and such an ass
But I can't find the ones I used to like either, lol
An extremely underrated moment that the dub nailed perfectly
"Death is not an apology!"
I don't think enough people appreciate the fact that Brook lived through Luffy's greatest fear and is still an amazing person
The ones Nekomamushi talked about? They're from Zou
Even when getting wailed on by Nami yeh
One of my favorite moments is when he depresses himself in film Z, lmao
Jinbe and Brook, two best strawhats
üíØ
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-XrB5VJ20g
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wve7Y8mC2fw
Little humor to lighten things up
This is the dub version of it
How is Luffy's not sad?
He lost his best friend
And he almost died and got his mentor permanently disfigured because of his stupidity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btS55sqgR9E
I love Brook and Chopper's interactions
They don't happen enough
But this shit was hilarious, even in the dub
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uH546_LM-9I
zeph
Fujitora comments about that
when he, Doflamingo and Law are on Green Bit, just before the asteroid crashes
If you want to grab a specific panel for it
no, I mean specifically the name Joker
Fujitora asks about it, indicating they don't know
^ It's a server event
She doesn't want to kill them after
By complete and total accident
It's also a royalty thing, anaum
I think Oda was going for a bit of both there
About 2 minutes till episode stream
Stream in about 2 min if anyone's interested
Tonight's anime ep
They can't buster call totto land or Wano
Damn this opening is fire
I missed it last week
https://angelthump.com/onepiecediscord
<@!510934064610541580> We're pretty lax, just don't spoil in the wrong channels or do anything overly crass or offensive, keep those as a good rule of thumb and it's all good üëçüèæ
But also the actual <#456573949120217089> , lmao
The Strawhats couldn't overcome it at all lol
They escaped because Sanji is incredibly clever and was in a good position
I was expecting a gag there
like Zoro just commenting on the sake being empty or something
You can give it willingly too
;-;
LOL
What's this? The anime admitting Zoro is *not* the vice-captain? <:CrocoKid:487633532907159552>
Tottoland is very much safer than Zou
Just barely, but Big mom trumps just being hard to find
I love everything about Hyogoro in the anime
!modlogs 546182530148335656
!standards
<@!546182530148335656> Let's not do stuff like that
wooo
Kaido's been caught and imprisoned already
He just broke out
It's hard to destroy paper
It's waterproof
and fireproof
It's very hard to destroy
Well, besides just like cutting and tearing it
Being underwater was just fine for it
Zoro didn't shoot out armament haki lmao
Vivre cards aren't indestructible
They can be torn and cut lmao
They're just waterproof and fireproof
The thing he's been shooting out since Skypeia, air
Yes, a slash imbued with haki
Not the way you'd say there, no
No, we're talking about a very specific thing here lol
Your image there implied that cut was the same as what Luffy used on a tree in Wano, it was not
Sure, Zoro shot out armament haki
He did not use the form of it that hyogoro tried to teach Luffy
It wasn't even haki shimon, Mihawk has to teach him how to use it during the time skip
It's just the same philosophy
I guess technically? Not the way it's talking about, but sure rofl
Did you not see the rest of the image? lmao
roaches cannot survive nukes
A roach can survive radiation fallout, nothing is living through a nuke lol
If something *can* survive a nuke
There is no world where you're beating it with a sandal lmfao
Lots of things have survived from that time
Yeh, fishmen can't drown
Why is that such a shocking thing to state?
Yes, because he couldn't move at all without it
Because he has no energy to move in the water
He wasn't in any danger of drowning at all
the World Serpent being the Red Line would be great
More so if Elbaf's general inhabitants have a specific legend or reason to want to take it down
And just live without doing it for the sake of some established peace or something
Should be out some time soon, if it's on schedule
We'll link to it when we get it
Appearance has rarely played a part in it for this series tbh
Lola didn't marry him because he wasn't her type or some such
It'll probably be a gag tbh
He might be, yeh
Shanks may have no relation to Elbaf at all
No, the theory is that shanks will be on Elbaf because he doesn't seem to be coming to Wano, and there aren't too many islands between Wano and Laugh Tale <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Shanks has never had anything to do with honor in the same sense, I hope that isn't the common tie here
Process of elimination
That was the first reason
Everything else is just justifying that elimination lol
That's...so loose
The Red Force being more Viking looking is a good bit of connection, that's about it for me tbh
Everything else is loose and doesn't even apply to Shanks for the most part
The honor bit, I have no idea where that's coming from
Inb4 Oda just tells us Roger really wants scrambled eggs from this bird who lays giant eggs, but shiki interrupted their breakfast <:LUL:321931602655707136>
I would love that, pasta lmao
They're not coated in haki
Because they're weird and Oda took hundreds of chapters to mention them again
The egg was never even mentioned, it's just there
They may be, or some other thing related to the swordsman, but they're not in a constant state of coating
Otherwise no swordsman who can raise it would ever need to imbue their blade again
That can't be Uranus, Roger never got an ancient weapon lol
Or endangered, probably yeh
<@!628142565496979467> Because we just had a flashback to the height of his piracy, and we know the weapon he encountered
Yes, he did
Poseidon
Not Uranus
10 years from there, king
No, there was specifically a mention that he had
And we know the weapon that was meant for now
He didn't read all of the poneglyphs and was never interested in the weapons
Why would he know?
Roger was one of the two strongest dudes walking the planet
The man *is* the weapon lmao
13 years before, sure lol
Roger's illness didn't affect him at all unti ljust before he hits Laugh Tale lol

As we see here, they had no interest in the weapons
Did it have to be, tanu?
No naism, that's not implied at all
And Rayleigh directly states they don't care for the weapons
He was about 10 years from it, it naything
At *least*
What does that have to do with him finding the ancient weapons?
<@!628142565496979467> You're operating on a lot of baseless assumptions here
We don't even know what One Piece is, let alone that it can be used at all
It's not impossible, but given what we've been told
between his entire lack of interest in having the weapons, his flashback, and the actual ancient weapon identified for us
Odds are, he did not have any of them and only knew about Poseidon specifically
>*just* creating a new age of piracy
Come on tho
The weapons, beyond Shirahoshi, have never even been important
As far as the main plot goes, that is
If Roger had all 3, it wouldn't even matter to use
Shiki says he found a weapon, but that was also before they got Oden to Fishman Island so it wasn't Shirahoshi
There's a One Piece chat going on, come on
!modlogs 289876647354826752
^
That was before he knew about Poseidon
About exactly one weapon, yes
The location of which, not that he had it
Or, he just found out where it was and left it in place
Might be yeh
No, we saw everything that happened the year after that event
We saw everything about the year after that, yes
While it's sad that she decided to give them to the government instead of giving them to families
That's about...literally the worst part about everything she did, and nothing else
Just that they went into government service instead of a family
She didn't promise them a bad life or anything
John Giant's a vice admiral with a LOT of clout in the marines
And getting to protect the Celestial Dragons is actually one of the highest stations in the world
Government service can be a bad life, it isn't for everyone
Or even for most, it seems
In fact, marine service is the potentially bad one, working for the government seems to be where it's at
No no, we're not going to slap a triggering label on it and simplify her character to just that
She raised them in an incredible loving home and was seen as a saint to the public
Yes, she gave them up to government service, and that sucks
But she also raised them in the only loving home they'd ever had and treated them perfectly
No, that's a fact. She was not abusive to those kids in any way, at all
She kept them safe, kept relations with Elbaf okay, and gave them a home
Ya'll are assuming a lot about the future of these kids when the only one we know about made it big
Or....they're also vice admirals
Seeing as they were marines in One Piece
Or, y'know, government big wigs
Did she prevent any of their dreams, curiosity?
...no?
Oh sure, all but one of them died horrible deaths
Lmao, those don't count
That wasn't Caramel at least
<@!153450639924396032> You're gonna have to stop those weird exaggerated takes
I'm not assuming none of them did, i'm not assuming one way or the other
You're jumping to the conclusion because it makes Caramel looks worse
That's not weight to the discussion, that's just trying to shame her more lol
And every single one of them dies?
All but one, just automatically, no hope at all?
You weren't saying some of them die
You were trying to paint it like all of her kids were getting sent to a death camp
I never said it was right, wow
She, and yes she was
None of what caramel did was slavery, what?
Yes, into jobs
Yeh dax, what she did wasn't good
And I never said it was, or that she was a good person for it
But she didn't treat the kids poorly, and while it is unfortunate that she dealt with child trafficking
Literally all she did was give orphans government jobs for 50 years
No, one was a marine
We don't know what the rest do, she didn't just sell them all into the military
And she doesn't sell people to be fodder, she gives them up to be particularly great government workers or marines
You're right
she also didn't sell slaves for basic jobs
She gave up kids who had the potential to be great marine officers or high ranking government officials
This has nothing to do with law
It is until monday, yeh
It isn't even forced labor
She was selling them into *jobs*
Like, when we think of human trafficking IRL, naturally it'll get a backlash because people aren't being sold into potentially better lives than they ever could have had
No Wow, it's going by the manga
She doesn't sell people to be lowly classes
She gave up only the ones she thought would be the big winners
She wasn't just selling grunt work to the government and marines
This wasn't Disco at Saboady
Yeah, that's the worst thing about it naism
Only two, zeph
Since we don't know snack's thing, lol
Cracker and Katakuri were weak to water
Smoothie powered up with it
so only two
He might be able to more yeh, but she can also potentially hurt him more if he throws water at her
Caramel never abused Big Mom, actually
She didn't get the chance to
All Big Mom ever knew was her to be a loving mother and nothing else
Until Linlin munched on her
I mean yeh, lmao
Liatris, this isn't willful ignorance, it's nuance. If you can't see past just the label, you don't have to be part of the discussion, but it can't just end at "She did a crime, it's the worst thing ever"
But you're not gonna get disrespectful about it, that's for sure.
After HOURS, I'd love that, lmfao
No one's saying she's good, no
She's just not Satan incarnate
Nope, never once naism
All I said was she gave the kids a safe and loving home, which was true. It's shitty that she sells them later
But even when she does, she's selling them into full paying government jobs
Like...this is probably the best case scenario of that kind of situation
Wow, I have the pages
I'm reading them now
And you're gonna have to acknowledge this

>She is not a good person
<@!683663101186277416> Bruh. Who said otherwise?
^
She's not in a gray area, she's selling kids. But, she's also giving them a good home and putting them in government jobs
You're making it sound like they're concentration camps, wow
I'm not saying it's the best thing ever, but they're getting presumably full benefits, a paycheck, and a lifelong status that will do nothing but benefit them potentially
Now, if they go to the marines
That's when it'd be worse, but even then
Still government support and a paycheck
It's not that what she did is good, or that she was a good person
nor was that ever my point
Mkay, so let's keep them orphans
'Cause we've seen how orphans turn out in this series
Just so much  better, right?
Yes, lmao
waaaaaaaaaay more
We've seen so many more pirates hurt their people than marines hurt theirs, come on
<@!131218004540129280> IRL, yeah
For sure
In One Piece, there may legitimately be no difference in a lot of place slol
When I said my bit up there, I was thinking of Whitebeard for example
Liatris, nothing to do with it
You're totally misunderstanding my comment there
Whitebeard's island, Sphinx island
Was devastated because of a lack of government support, and was filled with orphans
Caramel not doing what she did could have been just as bad as her doing what she did, except now she guarantees the kids get *some* form of support that isn't someone like Streussen coming along
One Piece isn't that organized
Tbh if she ran a legit orphanage, she'd have no resources to actually help the kids lol
She'd only be able to take people at face value
It's not, but running it on your own outside of any form of government support is wow
Especially in the New World, on an island basically nowhere
Her devil fruit requires her to take the souls of other things to do that, wow
No, she couldn't have leased out much work
Unless she was gonna get people  to donate their lives for her assistance, lol
So she'll just give up her life instead?
Not at all, I just didn't think she'd kill herself to make ends meat
But sure, she could make homies out of her presumably much shorter span now, since she's also older
The farfetched bit about it is how she'd make it, wow
Big Mom is a freak of nature
Where would she get the life span?
Hers?
Unless she can recycle and bring it back in, that's really farfetched
You're basically asking her to kill herself for her business
It's not like Tottoland where Big Mom has her whole population willing to give for her
Caramel was that one little old lady
Caramel, strong
....probably
Have we ever had *any* indication otherwise?
That's pretty much been the working assumption since we've never actually seen anyone get their soul back or anything
She might be able to, yeh
Wow, how? She doesn't recreate her homies every day
And they're still alive
she's not getting that soul back lmao
Maybe she could bring them back in, I guess?
But, Big Mom's a bad example for that
'cause she's not cycling her life force out, it's just out and staying
Oh she is strong, the point was that she pretty much did it in the best possible way
Gave them a decent home, put them into actual jobs and not just shady slavery
She was bad, for sure
But she wasn't Disco at Sabaody or anything
Yes liatris, because it 100% lacked nuance
Yeh exactly
Unintentionally, i'm sure
CP0 is an excellent job wtf
Literally the second highest station in the world
Stick to selling them to the marines as bad
Selling them to CP0 sets them for life
Oh yeh, did it for 50 years right?
And she never ruined her image
<@!289876647354826752> What do the CD's having slaves have to do with being in CP0 being a beneficial job?
Wow, leaving them on a warrior island without families would equally get them killed
Yeh, just for her image carl
She wasn't good at heart, she was just relatively safer
^ That's a big thing
Big Mom was going to 0 families
Actually selling her into the government would've been literally nothing but benefit to her in every single way
That was 100% the best thing Caramel could've done for her lmao
The other kids, those were the sad ones
Yeh, somewhere near Elbaf dax
No, not the only possible option wow
Not at all, but I also wasn't saying that
nor was anyone else
This wasn't a situation of desperation, it's just not as bad as it could've been
also brb
Stay civil, you're doing well
Caramel had nothing negative to do with Linlin's development
AT ALL.
Now, let me be clear here
It's not that she didn't mean to be or anything like that
Or she was a bad person
She never got the chance to actually fuck Big Mom up
She was going to, for sure
But none of how Big Mom is, negatively speaking, is related to Caramel
In fact, Big Mom's only positive qualities come from Caramel raising her
Exactly lmao
<@!683663101186277416> You keep putting words into my mouth
I never commented on that at all lmao
Yeh Wow, I know we talked about alternatives, but I only brought up how difficult it would be to run a legitimate orphanage because Caramel just isn't the person to put that effort in
Elbaf was a warrior nation filled with giants, and they all wanted Big Mom dead
She actually *did* do what's best for them by leaving
Specifically because of that circumstance, not a general thing
Liatris
Before I come down on you for doing it again
Go ahead and quote where I said any of it was justified for me
Liatris, you keep very purposefully mistaking my argument here
I've never given any support beyond the fact that Caramel actually gave those kids over to better lives than they probably would've had
Just being random orphans in the New World
What you said there was not my argument at all
<@!153450639924396032> So, that means that her trafficking kids is justified somehow?
Because someone insisted CP0 was a bad and dangerous job when it's probably the second or third highest position in the world?
That's fine, you're under no obligation to üëçüèæ
<@!257978175647252480> LOL
<@!186562609254891520>
CP0 isn't going to get turned into slaves
They're the only direct hand of agency the Celestial Dragons have
The Gorosei would prevent it
Probably not, tbh
He may be able to, but I doubt they're allowed to
^
*Might* use them somehow
Or they'll feature in it
But ultimately I'm hoping One Piece is entirely different
Yeh archer, I've always thought so too
Especially since, even before the flashback, we know the poneglyphs have the info on the ancient weapons
Not Laugh Tale
In fact, Laugh Tale's had nothing to do with them beyond the fact that poneglyphs help you find it too
Maybe Elbaf will end up doing it
<@!508198451872268288> The sea kings go crazy when Poseidon is distressed in general
You'd just have to put her on an island and torture her till she screams, they'd try to tear it down getting to her
The location was known in Alabasta, but I don't think it was hidden there
Here's a new one
What if Pluton isn't a weapon?
Or Uranus, for that matter
What if they're actually supposed to be used for constructive purposes?
Not that it's a lie
But like, their actual purposes weren't supposed to be for wiping out islands
Maybe it was even supposed to make them?
What if Uranus or Pluton helped make the Red Line?
If something has enough power to create stuff, it's got more than enough to destroy them
And if they had some hand in making the Red Line, wiping out an island should be cake
Not Poseidon, I was thinking more Pluton or uranus
Poseidon could be entirely unrelated to them, too
They could just be the 3 most powerful things from the Void Century, as opposed to a specific group of things directly connected
But yeh, if Pluton could actually help create an island in some way
I'm sure that'll happen, Archer
Lmao, it was a good one
Quality meme
Oars was called the Continent Puller
Were all of his people or just him?
I thought it was a unique title
Aaaay asante
Sab, I DAMN SURE DO üòÑ
I haven't ordered the book yet, unfortunately I am too broke, ugh
But soon tho, she's gonna love it
LOL that one still hits, haha
Oh really? I might look into that, lol
^
There's a reason Poseidon is a weapon that can "destroy the world" lmao
You really think anyone can stop an army of them?
no, he really can't tho
Name one person in the series who's killed an army of them
A swarm of things 1/5th the size of an island each getting on you is a death sentence, no matter who you are
ONE sea king can be taken care of, sure
1000?
Hell, 100 is your island destroyed
Mihawk doesn't row, but yes he does
Rofl, our biggest things to remember are don't spoil in the wrong places and don't be too crass
Keep those in mind and 9/10 times you'll probably make the right choices üëçüèæ lmao
No, wait wait
> if these high tier characters can easily own them > what happens when its the whole world vs the sea kings <@!289876647354826752>
We know what happens
Because the series told us
They lose
The world, that is.
Anyone who's ever talked about the ancient weapons ever, lol
Exaggerating there, but yes, the general consensus is that the ancient weapons bring about the destruction of the world
It's the whole point about keeping them from anyone's hands
Literally the whole point is that each weapon can bring about worldwide destruction
And incidentally
The fact that the Calm Belt exists with its reputation at all
Should show you that the world can't handle them <:LUL:321931602655707136>
The Calm Belt was swam through by one of the strongest people in the world, and he only had to fight one sea king that we know of, not every one in the belt
Need help verifying?
Wtf no
Sea kings have never been an easy thing to kill
They've *never* been seen as simple prey
That's why, like you said, they're a Worf
They're acknowledged to be particularly powerful
And it's to show how unique it is for someone to actually be able to handle them
Yes, because they're the byword for power in the sea
<@!420202273885519872>
They don't even need 1000, 100 sea kings could take an island out easy
10 could probably cause massive structural damage to it
Now mind you, it took Momonga
One of the more notable vice admirals
A bit of time to kill a sea king, and he didn't like having to fight it
I used to live in Tennessee
And Franky, pasta
So it took 6 sea kings to pull something half the size of an island
Now, when it comes to logias
Obviously sea kings can't do anything because of the lack of haki
But, barring those, they're still a viable threat to everyone
Minus the dudes they literally just can't touch, lol
Color of the Supreme Sea King <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Oh, actually
A group of sea kings would probably just cause a tidal wave
I forgot, fishmen fighting changes currents in the ocean
Sea kings fighting would probably drown an entire country
Aokiji is uniquely powerful against them, that's like saying Enel's not strong because he can't hurt Luffy with his fruit
Zunesha would get eaten by a swarm of sea kings lmao
^
Zunesha is frail
It's massive, and ancient
this isn't a croc
These are massive serpents that can swarm and bite through ships
Zunesha's body is not particularly durable
Jack blew chunks away with just cannon fire, and cannon fire doesn't actually do much to sea kings
They could just swim away from Zunesha before it fell lol
That's really not a good fight for the elephant
Why? That's a long fall
They'd just have to go the way he's not
Probably not, dax
That's the other thing, sea kings could just chew through its leg
Her trunk can't reach underwater like that
The legs probably wouldn't be able to do much, they're munching on it lol
It couldn't, it reaches into the sky
Jack was one thing, he was on the surface
Sea kings attacked its *feet*?
I doubt Zunesha can reach that far
It ducks down, and its truck still can't reach well
This is bottom of the ocean potentially
And even getting in, there's no swing zunesha could do to fight them off
It'd be in water lol
Unless it can use the trunk to crush them or something, it's still useless
Because of Hancock's snakes, yeh
They're afraid of the venom
It does not, lol
So you take encephalograms?
Well, Calm Belt sea kings are the average
The ones like the Lord of the Coast are outliers
But, they are intelligent yeh
Ahh
Another banger theory <:CrocoKid:487633532907159552>
You could be right tho, what if one of the last Poseidons was a Kozuki?
It doesn't have to be, we just know it from the series
the Calm Belt sea kings are *the* creatures, they're not the unique ones
I believe so yeh
Just certain mermaids
It's their nesting grounds because of the weather, dax
No choppy waters
There's no weather at all
A sea king tsunami is probably how they end up wrecking an island <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Just full on sink it
No killua, not unless they're moving in groups constantly
I said that earlier, lol
Uranus may be something for creation instead
Killua, there's a difference between a *current* and a *wake*
They create a wake
They won't make a current unless they're all going together
That does happen, killua
Sea kings just don't surface unless someone is sailing above, so you don't see it

Chap 525 btw
The damn readonepiece site cuts the page
So I had to google for it lmao

Only bad thing about the site I swear
they just can't do a spread right
I mean...don't knock it till you've tried it
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
Kade?
LOL I'll try to get it back up at some point
COVID unfortunately made me pause it
BEAN'S BEANS
I should've used that lmfao
Lmfao a coffee stache
I think that may come across wrong for some folks <:LUL:321931602655707136>
LOL
brb throwing it on my bags
He can understand what they're saying yeh
Oh, I misread that, I thought you were saying he couldn't understand the sea kings and such
yeh poneglyphs have powerful auras
The same "voice" you hear with observation haki
That also wouldn't make sense in the context of his character, he rose to being an Emperor because he's such an unstoppable monster
Even considering his losses, he's only lost 7 times in his whole life, that's pretty impressive
why does Sanji need something unique to him?
Sanji's got one of the most unique fighting styles in the crew
Nami's invisibility is canon
Zeo?
Oh, FMI dude
He's probably dead now
lol
Yeh, it's a mirage technique
She can turn invisible and make clones
But Sanji's still unique about it
He, nami, Shiliew and Zero all have entirely different ways of doing it, which is cool
She was invis and made clones I believe
Juba you're probably right about that
^
It seems like you get to the same point eventually no matter what
Just you might lean one way harder than the other, like the emotion bit
>Artur
<:LUL:321931602655707136><:LUL:321931602655707136><:LUL:321931602655707136>
<@!415999229564157955> No, it's because of speedreading
but it doesn't help for sure
^
I like how ubiquitous it is, there's at least one person in every arc besides the strawhats who can use fire I'm pretty sure
And of the strawhats, almost everyone can use fire attacks lmao
Sanji, Zoro, Luffy, Nami, Franky, Usopp
Can all use fire
And I'll add Kinemon as honorable mention
Y'know what I'll take nami out, 'cause she just makes heat but not full on fire

Yeh, she also turns invisible lol
I think not defending is more important than being drunk
He was also drunk fighting Luffy and didn't get a scratch
Like, the whole raid?
We've had almost 4 different arcs
Dedicated to reaching the point of this one attack
I don't think anyone underplays it tbh
Yeah, bad headcanon will get in the way of appreciating the story
but that's a them problem, not a story problem lol
And the 20 years it took to get there
Nah, that was entirely the fact that the scabbards came out of nowhere when they were supposed to be dead
Didn't know*
It's not like Orochi hasn't been raving about it for 20 years <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Pfft, Lucci was hardly in better shape than Luffy
Yeh, unlike Luffy, Lucci actually had to take his hits lol
No, he was just exhausted and barely conscious
Mostly from his gears, from what Lucci seemed to imply
Dried empty...of blood?
Katakuri wasn't leagues ahead
And he himself points out how close Luffy is to him
Don't let your headcanon ruin the fight
Katakuri's armament wasn't stronger when Luffy was using Gear 4th, and Luffy was steadily closing in on his future sight
Katakuri also couldn't use it consistently towards the end of the fight
And his fruit wasn't the upgraded version of Luffy's, he could just pull similar gimmicks lol
He also didn't just choose to lose or fall down instead of fighting
Katakuri was giving it his all, he passed out because he couldn't fight anymore
Yes, Luffy can't sustain it, and Katakuri let him keep fighting
That's the only thing that happened in Luffy's favor, Katakuri wanted the fight to finish
Ugh I can't wait for that to die
Mihawk had to teach Zoro haki
So it wasn't that back then
If it was, absolutely wasn't the second form of it lol
It does, mip
Ryuo is just haki
The levels are the lengths of projection
Yeah, and it does have levels lol
What are you saying exactly?
Yeh it wasn't ryuo lmao
It's not, otherwise Hyogoro wouldn't have been able to oversee his training
tanu
Hyogoro taught Luffy
with his bare hands
What is this speedreading rn lmao
Rofl yeh, it's more a translation than the actual card
Stop
No spoilers at all here, pls
You can talk about the current episode freely, nothing past
And nothing that may be spoiled in the opening
The anime is at 936
So you can talk about 934 just fine
Sure üëçüèæ As long as it's not spoiling future episodes or events
No that's fine, if it's been animated it's free game
I'm caught up, we stream the episodes a little after they drop here every Saturday
Yeh costa, that's what he says pretty much
Armament, at the least
They don't seem to have a word for conqueror's yet
And they may not have a concept of observation either tbh
Well, the thing is costa, he's referring to it in reference to Luffy using armament
Tanu, we've seen exactly one person from Wano confirmed using it lmao
Everyone else has just used general armament haki
<@!337779264130646021> That's also the other thing, we've seen more samurai use general basic armament than anything
^ Evidently using the technique that can actually harm him, too
That's in a lot of headcanon, tanu
They've never actually talked about haki before
Before Hyogoro decided to teach Luffy
We know he means armament haki specifically and not all kinds tho
Because he specifies it's the power that can flow into your sword from around your body
<@!690158729685106749> Yeah, they didn't do that because that's objectively incorrect lol
Why should everyone agree to it for only that? That's like saying we can only use mantra for basic observation, but not the extended version
<@!704073918759043093> Doesn't seem to be, off the top of my head
Mostly because he used to push his aggressively shallow headcanon
Now it's just a meme <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Well, he did it a bit more shady than that. It wasn't like he just made bad theories, he'd do translations and "facts" but pepper in his own opinion to decide an issue instead of just an unbiased translation
Arturpiece was just overly wanked'
But beyond that, I don't t hink anyone really dislikes him, lol
Since it was my hit, tell him to shoot me a FR and I'll let him know
I don't want him back yeh
He was out because of a lot of degenerate derailing and weird ass creep comments, ugh
<@!564773067969265674> It'd be like he'd translate a vivre card and insert something that was just clear not on the card at all
He did it in multiple channels too, I wouldn't have even cared if he stuck to at least one place to be lolrandom
<@!145193576165408769> I just realized I wasn't in koya's server, my b
Have you talked to him more? 'Cause I can shoot him a DM if not
That'd be really interesting
It didn't seem like their clash took long enough for that tho
^
I feel like Roger told him, and instead of getting it
He knew Fishman Island would be in danger if it was kept there
So he moved it
fr fats
The slightest thing out of place and it all breaks, ugh
I like your dedication
pls keep going rofl
Make one of Kaido turning into a dragon tho pls
fats real talk
when this quarantine is done and gone
we're having a BBQ
night frost
Either my amazing new pad in Oregon, or your amazing new pad that you'll probably have by then too
No but really, I'd be down to host a gathering
When I'm fully moved in and settled
Aaay
Sab and I are already planning to hang when I get up there
I'll be so close I'll probably end up seeing him a lot
Just move in at some point, why not lmao
Blackbeard's already offered to let him live by joining the crew
He doesn't care about the strength
>The Worst Generation
Not really, more just people conveniently liking him enough to help
But, Luffy also went out of his way to challenge the government
Evidently, most other pirates don't do that
Nepotism when?
Kuma only ever saved the strawhats once, and that wasn't a deus ex machina, it just hasn't been explained yet
But was part of a larger scheme
People usually want to kill Luffy because of his father and grandfather
And being related to them has caused him endless trouble lol
Being trained by Rayleigh wasn't nepotism
And like...all of them were already laid out beforehand
The only thing out of nowhere is Bege's help with any of it
It's not a deus ex machina if the series has spent time meticulously building up these elements coming together
That's not even a deus ex machina, that's just a poor red herring
But, that was pretty convenient for it to be like...literally just handwaved lol
Nami having more of the card makes sense to me, she's a planner
He absolutely realizes it
I'm pretty sure he's already acknowledged it, even
Maybe a couple of times
Well yeh, he's true to himself. Luffy has astounding strength of character, that's always been a thing
That's not something he'll ever stop
The entire point of the series is that the greatest pirates are free to do those things if they want
As far as that is concerned, that is
Given that he only told Luffy he may encounter people who do have it, I doubt it
I dunno, Zoro ripping out a weapon from his shoulder with his mouth and using it to finish off another powerful person felt a little more epic for me
Even tho Hyogoro's had a deeper meaning
He didn't seem to be someone who could use it, judging by how he told Luffy about it
^
That's why I'm okay with him getting these things so fast tbh
'Cause he did spend two years training for it and had the concepts in mind already, but just couldn't use them
This is just him getting to sit and do it finally
And actually have an environment that sucks enough for him to get good with it, lol
Hyogoro may have been a little more iconic, but devastation always deserves more spectacle
Hyogoro was more wholesome
It's sooo behind
I can't wait for them to get to Big Mom chasing the Sunny tho
Jinbe ugh
But it was tho
Whitebeard tried and had a heart attack
I'm curious what you were gonna say tho
'cause I don't think Sengoku's conqueror's would've done much at all
Those instructions were the actual key to all of their victory, though
The entire reason they managed to pull a win was Sengoku's leadership lol
Yeah, they were all on the spot decisions
He just had an arsenal to choose from for his decisions
But he's the one who directed the movement of the entire navy, he's the one who decided when to use the walls, to have Sakazuki deceive Squard
No, it was Sengoku's plan naism
It takes a LOT to knock people out with conqueror's
The gap is so large that the person being knocked out isn't even worth fighting the user
The gap is so huge that Whitebeard's nameless people were able to stand against Shanks's
Hell, most of Big Mom's guests stood against hers
As soon as it happens, yeh
Which means Sengoku's the reason Whitebeard goes into the war even weaker than they could've hoped
Because that stab didn't stop him, but it was still a massive sword going through his chest and potentially spine
Luffy barely knocked anyone out, but yeah, I'm completely sure Sengoku would've failed to knock out almost everyone on the crew
If Shanks could only knock out less than half, I'm entirely sure Sengoku's missing the mark there
Yes, will of the target too
These were an Emperor's crewmates
He'd have knocked out a few I'm sure, since even Luffy does if I'm not mistaken, but it's not making a big dent
I'm pretty sure Luffy knocks out pirates too, but I don't remember tbh
No, but we've actually seen them take an Emperor's haki already
This isn't like a hypothesis, it's already happened lol
Most of Whitebeard's crew stood just fine against Shanks's, and according to Whitebeard that one was on full blast
So, we saw Whitebeard's crew take a full blast of Shanks's haki, and it knocked out maybe half at best
And only the rookies, at that
Why would Sengoku do even as good as that, let alone enough to make a difference in the war?
Kizaru was causing mass destruction in the war
People tend to forget we get plenty of collages of everyone getting down
Kizaru was actually flying around blowing everything up whenever he could
What else was he going to do in a war? rfl
Knocking out 50 people out of potentially 40,000 doesn't help very much lol
But, Luffy and Katakuri were just exhausted, Whitebeard's body was failing
Two very different scenarios occurred there
Tomorrow
Should be about 12pm EST, I think
That's a better way of saying it, it's still tomorrow for me lol
As for Kizaru, I believe we do see him taking on commanders
Oh yeh, actually, they can't hurt him come to think of it
He stopped Kizaru from blinking away when he did it, so he actually hits him
Kuzan opens a hole and lets the bisento just pass, it doesn't touch him
Srsly, more logias without future sight have done it with
In fact, no logias have done it with
Special paramecia fucking...
A heart attack was extremely debilitating and happened *as* Whitebeard was trying to do it. It physically stopped him. Luffy abd Katakuri were just exhausted and hurt, but still had hours and hours left of fight in them.  Whitebeard, in his last his last big fight, lasted maybe an hour or two. All of Marineford only took about 3. There really is no comparison here, Katakuri and Luffy had a lot more going for them on top of being able to stand and perform it without interruption. Now, if Luffy were able to do it as Katakuri skewered him, you'd have more of a point there.
The Ivankov thing was the years removal. What Luffy went through was the same thing Law did
Also, 50 people not worth fighting anyway getting knocked out in a war of over 100,000 is most definitely irrelevant.
That's the point of conqueror's, you're knocking out the people who didn't matter to the fight in the first place. If you can be downed by it, your numbers are as  irrelevant as you were to the person using it.
The worst effects were actually commented on when Luffy uses both gears at once
Not much for just gear 2nd. But the only other time in general it's ever mentioned is in Thriller Bark, right after Oars goes down and Chopper worries
A youtuber being wrong doesn't credit the argument tho
Anyone with a bounty of over 100 mil is admiral material
7-10?
^
But besides that, 100 mil was the official limit for when you're eligible for an admiral to be sent after you
If she's not a warlord anymore, unless they're all busy, she does deserve one
She's actually probably the least vulnerable warlord currently active
She had an entire island and army backing her up
On top of the Calm belt itself protecting her area
I thought 7-10 was a bit much, lol
I guess Blackbeard maybe?
So potentially 8
7 if not Blackbeard
Maybe 9 if Beckman can do it?
Probably not Garp tbh
Or the admirals
There are two Emperors who just declared they're going to go for the ancient weapons and open war on the world with them, and get to Laugh Tale either soon after or right before
This is the literal worst case scenario for the government rn
The marines almost have no choice but to intervene
They can't just up and find the weapons before Big Mom and Kaido
They don't have the information for it
And Kaido potentially knows exactly where one weapon is already
Well, I only mention it because we learned Sengoku does already, and I just figured if any other marines did we'd have learned about it by now too
They may reveal it later, who knows
whoa
Did someone just say the only strong sweet commander is Katakuri?
wtf
Cracker can make an infinite army of things you need to be as strong as Gear 4th to beat
Where would they get information? Kaido and Big Mom don't seem to know any either
Two Emperors declaring war on the world is a direct threat to the celestial dragons
^ There is no one safe from this
They are trying to wage war on the entire world
It's not even like they're just stockpiling to rule, they *want* conflict
This is an assault, people will get involved if it doesn't end with the raid
They were in Wano weeks ago
We don't know if they still are or not
> You brought it here and you're saying off topic? Seriously <@!198930928083402753> <@!736943713439449099> He was calling himself out for mentioning something off topic during a conversation
Chill
Because they had a deal in place already, they didn't need a spy
And no spy would help that, Orochi's demands were more than they could take
Likewise, they wouldn't want there being any hint at all of a spy in general
Just like they won't just use Drake to attack Kaido instead of sending other marines in
If Kaido went by himself to Marineford he would have absolutely been slaughtered
Like, without question and probably without more than just a lot of collateral damage
The man would have no chance storming the place and living
He very well might have, we've never seen him travel with a crew
No, he was intercepted, we don't know if he had a ship
^ You guys should know that just because you're choosing to be under someone doesn't mean you're a yes man
Sengoku absolutely was not
Not at all lol
If he doesn't land, he wouldn't actually be able to do anything
His boro breath is strong, sure
But between Whitebeard, the commanders, the admirals, the Fleet Admiral, and Garp?
Kaido's not touching anyone lol
Garp couldn't even handle Whitebeard
No one is handling Whitebeard *and* Kaido
If they're not expecting him, they'd still be seeing a massive fireball falling out of the sky and need to either defend or get out of the way
Yeh, and unless Kaido brings his crew with him, he'd just be another corpse
They'd just go after him instead of chasing down the surviving Whitebeard pirates
Since he's a much bigger issue
And if he were anywhere near powerful enough to actually take the marines on alone, there would be no balance in the world
He'd be the undisputed king lol
It's been shown multiple times
Just only once as a defense
It is yes
No, it is the advanced kind
It's the kind Hyogoro can use
Ryuo is just armament haki, but yes, it is the kind that Hyogoro knows
The projection ability
Yeh, including Kid, there's 8
Not including blackbeard
Zeph said in or around, and all the Supernovas were there
Several people have used it yeh
More non-admirals have in fact
He does not
He has a specific technique is all
His Ashigara Dokkoi is how he attacks with the armament, it's not a different term or anything
^
Just with a lot less range it seems, but yeh, it's a projection
And it's what the admirals, Sentoumaru, the Boa sisters, Rayleigh, Hyogoro, Whitebeard and Roger have all used
Potentially the scabbards just did as well
And it seemed that Whitebeard and Roger using it was so particularly powerful their swords didn't even touch
Sengoku was never really told to do anything, he just followed the law and organized things as best he could
The only time he's been really stepped over was at Marineford when the Gorosei wanted to cover up the breakout at Impel Down
Wasn't the first?
What orders were Sengoku ever given?
What about Ohara?
Of course he did
He's the one who organized the Buster call for it
and told Saul to shut up about questioning it
lol
Oh yeh, of course. Whitebeard and Roger fought a lot
So much their crews became friends even though they're enemies
Yeh, Oden was the one who'd never seen that before
So I imagine that means that the technique is both advanced enough that not many people on Wano know it, especially if Hyogoro was famous for it in particular, and its strength is generally a lot less than what they showed
Yeh
Katakuri wouldn't betray Big Mom
lol
Sengoku is the kind of guy who thinks dealing with criminals is right
He's not some saint, he was the head of the marines
Everything people think was bad at Marineford, for example, was entirely on Sengoku
The Buster Call was just fine, otherwise he'd have dismantled it when he was promoted
Yep, we can see that from when Shanks and Whitebeard meet
no
Yeh, that seems to be the idea
Blow him up from the inside out
I'd imagine he helps Luffy with Big Mom more than anything
Since that's his captain
It already does for me
I love literally everything about Big Mom
Even the amnesia bits are interesting
Pfft, I wouldn't even call it giving up zeph
Man just decided the fight went on long enough <:LUL:321931602655707136> bro gets tired y'know
Yep, presumably
Cept I doubt any of them will be bringing Yamato to Kaido
Yeeeh maybe
This won't be a strength thing tho, they need technique more than power
<@!274366418223497217> Y'know funny enough, katakuri and Cracker were the only ones who ever complained about how long it took Luffy to go down lmao
But
TO BE FAIR
They're also the only ones who've ever fought him for over 10 hours lol
Yeah, that's pretty perfect
Mayweather and Pacquiao again, or whatever that big fight of his was
But that's for <#513313452081545256>
Ancient zoans just recover extremely fast in general
And are especially durable
What's up reggie
<@!431406303798362123> So we're not going to ask questions like that around here
!standards
!whois 431406303798362123
!modlogs 431406303798362123
Well, he did knock an Emperor out, Laww <:LUL:321931602655707136>
But I guess he wasn't really giving it his all
<:ZoroNut:632474447462400010>
Lmfao that's a great way of putting it, I love it
Oh he knew, he notices she's fine right after that too
And promptly soils himself
lmao
He's only covered up two things for the goverment
What happened at Dressrosa never happened before because no warlord was found out besides Crocodile before
But also having said that, only Croc and Doflamingo were actually doing horribly illegal things
Had a dinosaur drop on her head and it *helped* her
!mamalogic
Did that not load for anyone else?
Nvm
The funny thing is Hawkins says the same thing later about Kaido
I love that it's a running theme that the emperors are particularly special pirates
Or they were such horrible losses and coverups that it was all he could take
He *may*  have had other things before, but he also doesn't seem too miffed about having to do stuff like that
Impel Down was one thing, that would lead to a whole new era of degeneracy revived
And cause such horrifying mass trouble that covering it up was a total, devastating loss for them
I could honestly see him wanting to resign just for that
Like, the level 6 prisoners didn't give a number, but apparently all of them were released (or killed by Blackbeard's crew) and just one could cause an entire country trouble
How could he face the problem?
Not like he could go out and track these dudes down himself
He's probably just got the dragon fruit
Especially since we know the ryu ryu no mi is a thing
Yeh, man was in his 70's and just fought a war that he barely managed to win without losing most of his marines
And on top of that, Blackbeard was born
And the New World was thrown into immediate chaos from Whitebeard's death, something sengoku knew would happen
Like honestly, just all of that all at once seems like enough to make a guy want to resign
yeh, his title is literally Hundred Beast Kaido, but contextually it's The Beast or King of Beasts
*The* Beast denoting that he's at the top of the food chain, so either way is accurate enough for me tbh
>losing several warlords
I forgot about this too
And even worse, two of them end up helping make the war worse than it needs to be lol
Drowning also just may not work on him
He could be some part fishman too
Oh yeh, they're not Spandam or anything
Jack's only fishman trait is his teeth tho
He doesn't seem to want to actually die, he seems to want something to kill him
Are you? I thought you were black lol
Kaido did let them go, Orochi didn't tho
<@!143219473585930240> Yeh exactly, that and his suicide stuff has never been mentioned again since
Even off handed comments
Makes me think he wants something flashy more than just death in general
It's a fox, so I assume he has to not have a fruit
Unless there's some other model or paramecia maybe that can let him change?
Guys, take those to <#164972407147200512>
Shit, that really was all in one week, LOL
Hell, wasn't that like 5 days?
>BB existing
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
Sakazuki really doesn't have that much to bitch about yet, all things considered
All that happened in a week, his troubles have been building up for a few months now lol
<@!377670308280139784> That user seems to be a particular problem, and this isn't really new it feels, would you consider a ban? Was it that bad?
I didn't want to be too draconic doing it, but I agree, I'd prefer less meaningless convo there
I'm gonna start recommending them speak in <#164972407147200512> or <#164970986284777473> if it gets either too off topic or too nonsensical about things that aren't strictly manga content
But, a second channel helps to alleviate some of that too. At least we can concentrate the problem to one channel instead of the other
<@!377670308280139784> Yeh I only bring it up because sidra was brought up as a problem with that not too long ago too
Like his people made it?
That'd be interesting strong
Might be what inspired Kaido to go for the weapons
At least, I hope he decided to do it because he had some actual info at first anyway
!modlogs 330375715247882240
Oh yeh, at this point since that's the second official warning they'd gotten, I support a ban for the next offense
Since it's for the same exact thing and it's been unofficially an ongoing issue with them
Doesn't seem like it, but they've been told about it in chat apparently
By multiple staff members, just the first official warning was a couple of weeks ago by Red
So definitely the absolute last straw here if it's getting to the point of insulting staff
I dunno if it was that far before since I'm not too active in <#206841928019476491> tho lol
No one despises the government
Not really
That's why they haven't taken them down, it wasn't until now that Big Mom and Kaido decided to get together and declare war on the world
*Now*, the government may be in trouble <:LUL:321931602655707136>
I'd like some kind of reference to Zephyr
Maybe he did or discovered something relevant to the present day
Doesn't even have to be a focus, just a quick mention
For sure doom
Yeh exactly, with all the extra stuff, lol
The admiral who trained the last generation of them
Hardly canon, I'm not sure if he's official
Oda designed him I believe, but it seems ambiguous
Tanu, Garp and Sengoku weren't the trainers for the marines, what's being taken from them?
Only people Garp have trained have been Luffy, Ace, Sabo, Helmeppo and Koby
They didn't care for them, but they weren't relevant beyond being in the way
Like, the government wasn't a target, they were just a thing on the seas
Unlike for the Revolutionaries or Luffy at Enies Lobby
It wasn't until Marineford, I imagine, that Whitebeard cared that the marines exist at all
Your diary.
probably not no lol
>Oars
>Ryuuma
Pretty strong <:LUL:321931602655707136>
It's like 838 or some such
But Jeff's probably right
Especially since Vegapunk helped discover it
It's probably come back up as something Vegapunk mastered, given his reputation
How is it bs?
Because the haki that the scabbards used is probably rare in the world
Yeah, that'll be a nice mystery to find out
Does the official say differently?
Yeh doen, that seems to be the case
Or, implied at least
>first time since Marineford that mass death is gonna happen
Did we forget about Punk Hazard, Dressrosa and potentially WCI?
Mass death happens a *lot* in this series lol
I never care about making a distinction between deaths in the present and in the past, it's honestly completely pointless to even make that divide
But having said that, there have been plenty in the present
the Bird Cage? No
Doflamingo tried to kill half the people in the country, and succeeded in a lot but not all
Yaaasss you've gotta make some small non descript video about it
It was stopped for about a second and took the entire country pushing against it to stop
for just that second
there's no evacuating from the bird cage unless you're Buggy
Because Caesar killed more than two people before present day Punk Hazard
That's smart, did you put a lever to wind it with the spindle?
In Impel Down, yeh
Into boiling blood
Recessive genes that are reactivated from the full moon
turning them feral and kicking their body into overdrive
Blood
Ace could've destroyed Magellan back then <:LUL:321931602655707136>
It was boiling enough to boil people to death, coded
Oh, I meant just because of the fire
Ace is immune to his poison 'cause it can't touch him, lol
Y'know, out of sea stone
Lmao haki poison, I love it
But nah I don't think that'll work, haki doesn't seem to prevent logia weaknesses from taking effect
Like with Katakuri at WCI
but hold that thought, break time soI'm gonna step out for a smoke
I need pictures of this someday ;-;
fon, you've got to appreciate good craftsmanship <:LUL:321931602655707136>
He does, but they're an anesthetic gas
It's an art that's almost a living philosophy for every single swordsman in Wano
It'd be weird if they couldn't use the same kind of haki as Oden
Kaido was drunk, defenseless and the samurai were using the kind of haki that can specifically harm him
Why wouldn't they be able to?
Why would it matter that he is?
Law hit Kinemon with something he's never seen before and left him in pieces
Of course he can beat him, just like he'd beat anyone who had no idea how his powers worked or how to defend
It's Ryuo, and while haki is a problem for him
that doesn't mean Kinemon knew that, or knew how to make it so that problem worked in his favor
He didn't even know what devil fruits were, they think it's just magic
Yeh, that's a big thing I noticed recently laww
and it explains why Wano specializes in it
Swordsmanship is a subtle art to master, not just chopping away at things with a katana
So it makes sense that Wano natives master it in particular
And Ryuo, while it is just armament haki, the higher forms involve a very nuanced technique
We can even see that with the way Luffy breaks Yamato's cuffs, it's nothing about brute strength at all, he has to slow down and relax into it
He does, yuka
And being a vice admiral would still be fine
First off, they're much stronger
but also, if a vice admiral could use that same level of haki, then they could hurt Kaido too
It's the technique, it's not power
I mean...this is a literal suicide mission
lol
Maybe
Not much moon related stuff that needs to be touched upon
Unless Sulong has something to do with history and not just genetics
You think Sulong is related?
Maybe, that'd be interesting
Oh, maybe, but I don't know
Also, it shouldn't be a surprise that this is how the raid is going
Oda already stated he didn't want Luffy to win just by having a stronger punch
So, we've got the amazingly subtle destruction of this new armament
Zeus can't do anything to Lufy
<@!420202273885519872> If you're still doing it in 3 hours, I may join in
lol
Is all good if not
Ay viri
Doctor's?
Ahhh, hope it's all good bud üëçüèæ
I've got that tomorrow myself, haha
There's also no telling if Kaido and Big Mom know enough about the new techniques that they can defend against them
Neither of them are really nuanced enough for me to expect it
Nor would they ever actually need them, lol
I'm alive, that's always good enough for me, lol
Lmao why thank you
You can find some very light free therapy online if you need, fon
Reddit has a lot of communities dedicated to mental health support, including chats
All he has to do is fly around a little
Kaido can take care of the moon easy
He can blanket the sky lol
Like, in seconds
He probably won't though
Yes, and maybe
They planned this specifically for the full moon
It's been a month
enel isn't an astronomer lmao
He has no idea how many  moons there are
He only knows what he can see
It was about a week to Wano, I wanna say
Maybe two
It was two weeks after Luffy landed on Wano that the raid started
So yeh, it's been about a month
Not months no
Maybe about a week or two before Luffy got there
WCI only took a week and a half to finish
A week to sail there, a couple of days there, a day to get out
Then on their way to Wano
Enel said he wanted to go to the Fairy Vearth
Which is whatever he decided it to be
Enel had a specific location, never "moon"
It was Fairy Vearth
Having multiple moons doesn't really cause any problems
They just say "moon"
^ The lack of plurals is something that has to be indicated
Sure he can spice
Just because there are multiple moons doesn't mean they're all prominent enough to either influence anything or be shown
Why would it be an asspull? It wouldn't affect anything
It doesn't matter if there are multiple moons or not if only one is out
Thing is, Oda hasn't really done any worldbuilding as far as that goes
It's not like this has been a massive subject for the series
It wasn't even really until now that we got characters who need the moon for something
Being massive to the fandom doesn't mean it's relevant to the series at all, druser
It wouldn't be that massive if it doesn't affect anything in the series tho
Unless it's actually important that there's only one moon, having multiple is irrelevant
It's just something some people like or dislike
No, if it doesn't affect *anything* in the series
I didn't say plot
Unless having multiple moons changes some part of the show, it's entirely irrelevant
Bruh I just said *everything*
I specifically didn't say plot lmao
Yeh druser, worldbuilding is actually used for plot here
Oda's not crafting WoW or anything
Yeh stoopid
now, something like saying there are two Gaon Cannons
That'd be important
Saying it's made of something besides Adam Wood, that affects things
There's about equal actually, alex
For it, we've only seen one
against it, we've seen the model
That's probably what it'll be King, lol
flying machine with nukes
there is a technology level in One Piece
It's the scale in relation to the Earth
There's a clear implication there
It's a scientific model
It's faaar more likely to be to scale than not
^
There's no applicable IRL reason for there not to be multiple moons
It really just comes down to a lack of active indication in the series vs portrayal
Oda could literally say they've only had one moon because the other 5 orbit the other side of the planet at the time
strong
Read that in the official lol
Because she didn't, she was deluded
And it's not an asspull if there's a foundation laid beforehand
Luffy didn't win because his will was too weak, he won because Moria lost his mind
He couldn't contain them because he was barely conscious and overflowing
Because he messed with his actual fruit
And broadened it
Much like how Caesar can use poison because of his own modifications
And other various things
<@!160778857702490113> Had a thought just now
Chopper and Caesar have directly affected and changed their fruit powers beyond their normal range
Do you think that would transfer over to the next host?
With Chopper's, they explain he actually distorts the power of the fruit itself to get his extra forms
Kaku was just abusing his biology
lol
Chopper actually went and changed his basic fruit power in general
Why wouldn't they be able to?
Well, I mean in general
Chopper's forms are just a natural part of his fruit now
Not just can someone else warp his fruit the same way, since anyone could do that if they're smart enough anyway
But if it comes pre-changed because of what he did to it
Yeh, the gears are just a technique
Chopper's changing his fruit's power beyond its norm
I'm wondering if next chapter will be the end of the act or anything
Or it they'll actually carry to the end of the raid
They don't make you sink, you jus tcan't move
Or, rather you're out of energy
Ye
Who says awakened abilities are unique?
So far that doesn't seem to be the case
In what universe? lmao
yeah, absolutely not
lol
Koby as a captain is not stronger than the entire Strawhat crew pre-skip put together
Like, i'm thinking maybe he takes down someone from CP9
*Maybe*
Butter is a paramecia <:LUL:321931602655707136>
That's even if koby can get to Hancock
This is still a whole ass nation, after all
>AND ROCKS D XEBEC ALIVE
<:LUL:321931602655707136><:LUL:321931602655707136><:LUL:321931602655707136>
The ultimate clickbait
"Sulong minks are taken down by KAIDO & One Piece is revealed?! Chap 988 discussion" <@!274366418223497217>
I hate that about youtubers, strong
We used to have a user who thought it was okay for it to happen
But like, I hate it when youtubers post spoilers in their titles
Ugghhhh I hate youtubers tho
Except like King of Lightning
Only because it's funny when his eyes bulge
jfc
We've gotta stop mentioning honor tho
There really isn't much in this series to speak of <:LUL:321931602655707136>
It's kind of a uniquely Wano dedicated concept, even
And they don't even mention it much
Ace's death was big for Luffy, Whitebeard's death was the biggest event in One Piece so far
If Ace had just been executed, nothing about the world would've changed really
Whitebeard was acknowledged as the end of an era
He didn't really mature much from it <:LUL:321931602655707136> Still goes into the time skip face first to any fight he can
^
He definitely grew in his resolve, that was the  building point of Ace's death
Becoming unshakeable as a pirate
Yeah nah, one thing I used to mention a lot
If you took Luffy out of Marineford, nothing ultimately changes in the situation
I think that impacted him more than anything
It's not just that he was weak, he was almost irrelevant completely
Luffy was barely running at that point, Akainu would've just come down on them
The crew does sometimes
But they still back him up without question, lol
At this point it's almost a gag, no Luffy don't go and spit in an Emperor's cereal pls
Yeh fats, that's one thing I don't like when I read about someone's take on Luffy post-skip
There's usually something about maturity in connection to Ace's death, and with the intent that maybe Luffy wised up a little
Instead of just planting his feet and becoming more of what he already was
Fortsy, Luffy really doesn't get wiser, just stronger as a person
But that was probably Oda's point, since that *is* Luffy
He'll never stop being reckless
Luffy's character arc isn't growing into Rayleigh
He'll never be a super mature, solidly set person, he's always the wear his heart on his sleeve guy
He's got plenty of emotional intelligence yeh, that's one of if not his best trait
Like, right up there with his sheer willpower
But I feel like people expect him to pull a full on MC brilliance growth or something
Doom, i'd say his changes are more toward what you said before
Exactly archer
He's not the one who's supposed to grow into a late stage life mentality
Yeh fats, I agree with that
Luffy's probably never going to change, and just become better in what he has as a pirate
Didn't Apoo or someone else get to that island as well?
Or was it Urouge who saw it?
And Apoo got the warthogs lol
The weirdest part of that silhouette is the hair
Big Mom looks closer to her silhouette than not
lol
Yeh doom, they took heavy liberties
His afro, ugh

Of course it did <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Pendas, was it made by Oda?
That wasn't anime only doom
It was just kind of a throw away
No pendas, it's actually got mistakes that contradict the series
It is not canon at all lol
It's just a nice story, and Oda's actually gone and called it alternate universe himself basically
I'm on a call, i'll grab it in a bit
Kanjuro doesn't have much behind him tbh
I'm fine with him being off screened specifically because it was by a scabbard
So they still get some of their revenge, but ultimately, it really was all about Kaido
To the point where another Emperor is hardly even part of the conversation for them, really
People have problems with Orochi because of Kaido, though
As much as he was the reason for things happening, it was entirely Kaido's hand that did it
Orochi was ultimately just another slave to Kaido who thought he was bigger than he was
And didn't even notice it
If he's alive, I'm sure we'll get some good scenes of people expressing it
but it's Kaido who ruined the country and enslaved everyone, Orochi just opened the door for him
<@!289876647354826752> Take it to <#738580480437387264> pls, there's a discussion going on rn
No, the Kozukis have unfinished business with Kaido more than they ever did Orochi
Even Shinobu acknowledges it
And I wanna say Kinemon's mentioned it too, but Kaido's been the big word since the start of the arc
Orochi is far from dumb
He's just pitiful
^
And even then, he's been playing things really, really well
If not for Big Mom coming around and Kaido deciding to expand his empire, he'd still be the winner
he'd be perfectly set
I see him duking it out with Big Mom more than anything
Yep
100million is high
It's high enough for an admiral to get sent after you
It's not about strength if they're not doing anything lol
They've been fighting for 100 years
why would their bounty be higher?
He couldn't control homies, he could only blow them away with the power of his soul
But, we don't know enough about the fruit to say that what he can do with it now is particularly special, or just basic powers he'd never thought to explore in his time
<@!548600820304969772> No, I don't believe so
Define an achievement as a character
Before you ask that question
It's fanart
Everything?
What *didn't* he do that would have?
You can answer that question with his entire tenure in the manga
And it's valid lol
> I like him a lot don‚Äôt get me wrong but he has no substance other than his connection and interactions with luffy <@!564773067969265674> That's actually objectively incorrect
And all of Marineford proves it lol
Ace had a whole arc where over 100,000 people, *well* over, were fighting either for him or because of him
It's okay that he didn't do much for you, but to say he had substance is soooo wrong lol
Chopper?
Luffy?
I disliked Ace because his death was a little too out of nowhere for me
As far as his motivations for it goes, that is
But that's more disliking the way Oda ordered his character development
Carrot, I have literally no opinion on at all
I feel like Carrot hate is almost completely just the fan division in her joining the crew or not
People love Big Mom here
We just get the odd power leveler who thinks she's weaker than the other Emperors and that makes her a bad character
Or because she isn't stronger than everyone, it makes her a bad character
lmao
What do people mean by substance?
From a writing perspective, there are an extremely small number of named characters without substance in this series
And mostly it's just because of a lack of spotlight and not because they're flat
lmao
Like, let's define it first
And then pick and choose who has it and who doesn't
Is someone substantial if they meet your good opinion?
Ace fits all of that to the letter lmao
Hm?
Why Katakuri?
^
That's fair
But, Oda just got to go into a lot more depth post-skip with his villains than pre
We don't get too many backstories for antagonists pre-skip for example
Whereas post-skip we're given more motivations and crewbuilding with them
Which is a nice change
Katakuri's writing is nothing too special tbh
The best part about him is that his character was affected by Luffy
Even after the donut scene, the best part about him is that Luffy affects him enough to affect the end of the match
Being perfect and then later being found out to not be perfect is...eh
It's cool, and it's nice that we got a bit more information about his relationships and how that came about for sure
But most of why people like Katakuri is his moveset over his character lol
Like, a cool character is not a substantial one
She's most definitely a villain
She just has an affliction
But anyone denying that is denying the fact that she is probably the singularly most successful Emperor out there
<@!276525516302057486> I don't do youtubers lol
Mark is the only one I like, but not because he's a one piece youtuber, I just like him
Big Mom has been the most terrifying Emperor to date
I have no idea wtf anyone's talking about if they say otherwise lmao
Buildup, sure
Well, not really
Big Mom's still been built up as far more terrifying
Kaido's just been built up as a beast
Big Mom's an actual horrific force of nature
But hang on, work call, I'll @ you with more
That's exactly what Brook is doing with the yomi yomi. All of his powers are just his soul leaving his body in some way, the only outlier is the ice
Even blowing away the homies was just flexing his soul out
The only thing he demonstrated that wasn't directly connected to the fact that he can move his soul freely is summoning ice from the underworld
Everything else is basically just he discovered his fruit allows him to control his soul, not just resurrect
Yeh, but his ignorance doesn't mean he discovered an awakening
Which is a bit of his foolishness, since the very first thing his fruit does do is allow him to control his soul, and he just never tries again
Oh, yeh, but that's not true though
lol
And even if we discount Luffy, Chopper's done *far* more with his fruit than literally everyone in this series who isn't Caesar
Let alone just on the Strawhats, lol
Caesar's the runner up there since he chemically altered himself, but it's not like he got more than gas powers still
It wasn't just doping, he directly altered his fruit's power
He actually *changed* his power
<@!683663101186277416> Alright, about Big Mom vs Kaido
So, Kaido's had a reputation built up for sure
He's been made out to be this invulnerable monster who's barely human, but at the same time, by sheer portrayal he's just been another powerful opponent
He hasn't been particularly scary, he's just strong
And that's inherently nerve wracking, but it's not overly terrifying beyond just you don't want to get hit by the guy
Kaido's crew has honestly been scarier than he ever has, so far anyway
Being able to cause massive destruction and not minding can be scary, but Big Mom can and does the exact same thing, so it can't put him over her
But Big Mom also far more frequently goes into uncontrolled rampages and wrecks even her own home
She's the only Emperor we've got that's been almost completely fleshed out, and she's almost a complete psychopath
That, and Kaido's been resisted before
Big Mom was just about completely unstoppable at WCI
She was this massive, hulking force of nature that could go so far as to make the damn near the island itself collapse on your crew if she wanted
When she showed up causing a tidal wave that almost sunk the Sunny, that was a lot scarier than anything Kaido's shown so far. I say that because we actually get the crew reacting to it, the sheer hopelessness of everything Big Mom threw at them was made so painfully apparent in WCI, versus Kaido basically just giving everyone a free pass if they're strong
It wasn't even only Kaido, Orochi also shared some of what made Wano a pit of anxiety
<@!439543733957165058> Thanks for @ing someone for it, but prefer if you don't tag all of the modsquad. üëçüèæ
<@!456583330738208779> You need to use the proper posting format 100% of the time here
That was a big spoiler for that arc
!modlogs 456583330738208779
!whois 456583330738208779
Oh hey, he's gone
More than there are in the series lol
Big Mom's very first portrayal
Was about how she sent someone to destroy a country for her
Her very *next* portrayal was about how she razed several countries to the ground just to make a birthday cake
Kaido's reputation is as a warmongering brute, and that's bad, but Big Mom's portrayed as a gluttonous force of nature
No, Kaido's crew is reputed to do it
Big Mom actually showed it
Only Zou, and only because of a weapon developed by Caesar
Big Mom does it just through her crew's own capabilities, and when she moves, she can even turn everything around you against you
No, I'm saying his reputation has been that way
That's the other thing, Kaido's actually been portrayed as semi-reasonable and not that bad of a guy
Y'know, relative to how people talk about him
He hasn't really been this bloodthirsty, conflict hungry demon that people like to report him s
He's actually avoided more fights than he's gone into
Yeah exactly, Big Mom isn't very simple, but she's a lot more on the nose with how she is
That's why she wins out against Kaido. Kaido's intimidating, Big Mom is pure horror fuel
As in, Kaido's been this calculating, strategic person who's actually cared about what he gets into and when
To the point where he was stressed and bitching about Big Mom coming because there would be a fight he didn't want
Big Mom is basically Luffy, on the other hand
Full force, straight ahead, nothing will prevent her
And when she gets there, she's getting what she wants
No, she doesn't want war, she wants to crush whatever's in her way
Kaido actually wants conflict, Big Mom just moves and destroys things on a whim
No, warmongering is wanting the conflict for conflict's sake. Big Mom doesn't want conflict, she wants her desires filled and is willing to end every conflict out there by ending the opposing side
Kaido wants his war, Big Mom wants to trample everything and get what she wants
Yeah, there's an actual reason for them losing at Water 7
it wasn't just a random turnaround lol
But it's not that he was clapped by Kaido in one hit so much as his absolute strongest barrage could do nothing to him
Oh no, she actually is strategic. That's the other thing, not only is she the most gluttonous Emperor, she's inarguably the most successful
She's actually established her *own* country
And has a legitimate empire going. She's incredibly strategic, and her a military that moves extremely well
and overshadows pretty  much every other emperor's forces, it seems
So even on top of being this strange, omnipotent juggernaut of vices
She also has an iron clad empire with a terrifying number of soldiers
On top of being able to make literally infinite more if she desired
And that's with three different factors in her crew, at that
*At least* three, actually
That, on top of a perfect information network that reaches all the way to the Blues? Yeah, the terror of her influence was made very clear in WCI as well, and it's a lot greater than Kaido's
It's just Kaido has a lot more destruction with his higher ups, it seems
But Kaido didn't silently take over the country, and he never controlled the entire underworld
Kaido was one client of doflamingo's, he was one of if not the biggest but absolutely not his boss or anything close
And Big Mom actually does control a good bit of the underworld
That was also driven home in WCI, especially when so many pillars of the crime world came to pay deference to her
No, he didn't *silently* take it over
It was very obvious and on the nose, and it was because of Orochi, not even Kaido that it happened
So that's not even something good to attribute to him. It was Orochi and Higurashi who went in and made it so Kaido could run Wano
Big Mom, however, does these things directly and herself, and actually has taken over multiple countries to get in
Kaido needed outside help, Big Mom was already ruling places when he had it
Doflamingo was the biggest player in the underworld, and Big mom was shown to have probably the second most influence
Kaido had Doflamingo under his thumb for exactly one thing, and that was Smiles
We don't, but we know he wasn't very powerful back then as a pirate
It took him years into Wano to get to just 1000 people behind him
Actually, Jack ran out of reinforcements he had so many lol
Queen only devastated Udon, and that's big, but that's just Queen
Nope, he brought multiple
a *lot*
He actually ran out of backup he brought so many and the minks defeated them
Yes, he kept bringing backup
He brought all the ships and then had even more go over lol
Sure, but we actually saw Big Mom doing it
for a LOT less reason, too
That's the big thing, Kaido brought down a country looking for a wanted person who could help bring him down
Big Mom wanted to make a cake.
And brought down *several*
It wasn't sheer numbers, we see single operatives reporting on it being done lol
The first report was only Bobbin coming in saying he did it
And we see Jack needing so many reinforcements he runs out of crew to do it himself
Kaido threw a LOT more numbers at a country so far than Big MOm <:LUL:321931602655707136>
It was yeh
And that brings me back to my original point
Big Mom's the most terrifying emperor shown so far because she's actually been *shown*
Kaido hasn't yet
Oh no, in lore Big Mom has been shown more terrifying
And in portrayal, inarguably it's been Big Mom, sicne Kaido hasn't had much time to *be* portrayed in conflict
Big Mom had a whole arc dedicated to how terrifying she is, kaido's still getting into it
He may be worse by the end of wano, but Big Mom's gotten a full show, and she's been absolutely higher in the horror
Big Mom was actually *shown* to be, Wow
You're skipping over that
Kaido hasn't gotten a chance to live up to his rep, and his reputation really wasn't much more than "He's stronger than everyone"
Big Mom's reputation was "If you disobey, you get a loved one's head in a box"
Thinking he's more threatening isn't the same as him being more terrifying
Big Mom's portrayal through all of WCI has entirely trumped what we've seen of Kaido *so far*
He's been a lot more human than she ever has is the problem
No, from a lore and portrayal standpoint, it's still Big Mom. That's the thing, Kaido's lore has literally just been that no one can hurt or kill him
Big Mom's has been complete domination
His Calamities had a more terrifying reputation than he does, lol
^
No, you're still not getting it, it's not that he's been shown as a big brute, it's that he hasn't been shown as a brute *a tall*
He's basically just been a not even unforgiving general, just one who really wants to fight...sometimes
He's scarred Wano for sure, and his pollution is sad
I've never done that, tho
And I keep putting the label down  lol
Yes, I know, I keep saying he is not
Yes, his lore is him being a brute
*He* has never been
Not at all, his lore has him being defeated
And ends with him being invulnerable
And/or unkillable
Sorry, was on a call again lol
So yeh, my point is that his lore calls him out as this violent creature who's challenged everyone and no one could put him down, even though he's been beaten before
Came out with him being virtually invulnerable, seemingly unkillable, and everyone talking about him talks as if he's pretty much the Hulk
But Kaido himself hasn't really supported those rumors as much, he's been a calculating, purposeful and insightful individual building a functioning army
Yeah exactly, that lore is the best portrayal he's gotten to put him anywhere near as bad as Big Mom has been actualized to be
In actual action, he's been a LOT more mild than she has, but just brutal here and there still
For example, Jack was cruel and sadistic, and I'm sure Queen and King are equally. Kaido has been shown enjoying violence and suffering too, but ultimately, he and his crew have rarely made it much of a game outside of Wano
Yeh, because Kaido's lore is mostly just building him up to be *the* big bad guy of the series
Big Mom's lore has her as a psychopathic monster, and she was fully shown to be the same
One of the first thing we're told about her is that if you deny her invite, she'll send you a loved one's head in a box
Oh, also personality
Big Mom laughs and cackles happily as people are hurt and killed, and enjoys when she gets to do it too
Kaido seems to just do it because people are in his way
Like, I imagine Big Mom would've tortured Orochi for a while before killing him, or even shoved him in Mont D'or's books forever
Kaido may be the guy who will cut your head off without a prior warning, and even enjoy as his crew tortures you, but Big Mom turned it into her own amusement. The wheel she uses alone makes her worse than Kaido in a lot of ways, for me
Pinning it won't stop people from posting it lol
Yeh exactly, he's willing to do things in the most brutal way to get what he wants, but Big Mom enjoys doing it in the slowest, most brutal way, whether she gets what she wants or not
And none of that is even bringing up the rampages too, that adds a whole other level of it for me
Only for now, not like entirely
Ehhh y'know, I think he has been. Only because he's the one who's come up with the New Onigashima Initiative, and that puts him on a whole new level of threat
He's the first Emperor who's decided to declare war on the world and has been working specifically toward it for over two years now, as opposed to Big Mom just chilling and eating
I'm still watching both channels btw lol
Honestly, i'll give you that just because he rose to an Emperor by beating down everyone else and making them part of his crew
Big Mom just wants more resource and a happy family, in her mind anyway
Kaido may not have conquered as much territory, but his crew is almost entirely made of people he's personally taken out it seems
Nah, he's an admiral
It's his job to be that strong lol
Yeh, but only  until we actually get to see Kaido going at it
Unlike WCI, we mostly see his crew being the sadistic ones
As opposed to WCI, where Big Mom was the sadist and her crew just kind of supported it
But on that note as well, her rampages are really interesting to me
The way I view it, that really puts her above everyone as far as fear goes, she kind of becomes this eldritch Lovecraftian symbol for me
Not directly, but only in that she becomes basically someone who doesn't care about your existence it feels
Where she's not chasing people, she's chasing bugs who decided to crawl on her cake
So we go from this person you can talk to and reason with who may be able to blow up an island, to this creature with barely a mind and a ravenous hunger and you happen to be made of ice cream
Who can *also* maybe blow up an island, lmao
Nah, she's never known as far as we know
Nami's got a scar on her back that isn't tattoed
Tbh I can't remember much of Nami's back post-skip in general lol
someone check the bathhouse scene <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Daily PSA:

Marine ranks
Yeh, looks like it's just faded away
But that's also different than the one she had before
Like that? No, that'd never fade
But, this is One Piece
Where it does lol
Armament is a barrier in general, it's just a measure of how far you can project it
Eventually ending in letting it explode in someone/something from the inside out
Rayleigh's the only one who showed that before Luffy learned it
I'm assuming Roger and Whitebeard knew it, too
But, unconfirmed. Seemed to be, tho
<@!155760010410983424> No, everyone else is confusing it more by incorrectly using the term lmao
It should never have gotten to the point of being just normalized as only the new kind of haki Luffy learned when it was never referred to in that way in the first place
Yes, for the first time since its introduction, the one and only time it's ever been used to refer to some specific haki was last chapter
And that wasn't even referred to specifically as the projection, Kaido just asked if they were using Oden's ryuo
We don't know that Oden knew the same lol, so that doesn't even help it
All we know is whatever they hit Kaido with seems to be the same that Oden used
So, it *still* hasn't actually been specifically used for the technique.
And nothing of value was lost <:LUL:321931602655707136>
The only thing is they're not projecting anything so far, they just managed to pierce his skin
So it's definitely not the kind Luffy's been breaking his ass to learn, if it is
It'd have to be the bit that Rayleigh and Sentoumaru knew
Er, Rayleigh showed when training Luffy, he knew both
No Toshiro, I'm saying Oden's haki doesn't have to have been the kind Luffy just learned for hurting Kaido specifically
It just has to be what Oden could do, and he didn't seem actually able to use that form
The internal destruction, that is
Oden didn't seem to actually  know the full form, just the projection bit we see from the admirals and Hyogoro
If even that
It wasn't just a cut to the skin, they plunged their swords into him
Kiku's went straight through his hand
20 years later, sure lol
Back then, yeah it was internal damage, literally every sword slash that happens makes people spit up blood in this show
It's always internal damage, someone was just slashed hard enough that it put them on the ground
The sign of haki is that he was able to damage Kaido *at all*, not that Kaido coughed up blood later
Well, the barrier is the projection
Oden didn't seem to even know about the last stage of Ryuo, let alone use it
Yes, you're projecting your haki forward, the internal destruction is the further kind
Where you're projecting *into* something
He did indeed
But that's natural, Raizo just cut his neck and Kinemon stabbed him in the lungs lol
I'd also like to point out that 100% of his injuries were gone by the time he flew to the roof, lmao
Caught you slippin, pasta <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Laww you could probably pull every sword finisher in this series and show them spitting blood
But yeh, once the sword goes in, that's just natural
'cause you were probably just stabbed or slashes in an internal organ connected to your esophagus
Let's go back to the root of the discussion tho
The use of "ryuo" in the chapter
As much as it was used specifically there for the technique, likely anyway since I can't confirm it for sure, that's still the one and only time it's ever been used for that sake
In his intro, he falls and hurts himself ll
Yeh we've really known he wasn't invincible since then
You should join, lurk in, have some fun
Don't have to talk tho
I'll add a little to that Pasta, throughout WCI we also see him representing Big Mom the most
Like greeting her guests, making Caesar's lab on her request, things of that nature
I wanna say she attends her more than anyone
*he
Kaido's crew seems to care
Just, they're also assholes
Kaido's crew cares as far as like not wanting someone on their crew getting their asses kicked
I imagine it was because it showed he needed help, and thus wasn't the strongest one around
Which goes against Kaido's entire philosophy as a pirate
Hyogoro actually can't do the third
so that list is very wrong
Luffy figured out how to do it on his own, and completely skipped over the second
Sentoumaru and the Boa sisters project their haki forward
Rayleigh was doing the same there
He uses the final stage at Sabaody
when he breaks Caimie's collar
And when he breaks hyogoro's collar
Also, two interesting things I just noticed.
no lmao
Rayleigh is the only person besides Luffy who's used it confirmed
^ What Shimon said
Its your list lmao
^
And Luffy vs Tree
Can't forget that incredible opponent
As powerful as Kaido's scales
The 6th Emperor; Tree.
Alright, so, those two things
Yes, only the second
Luffy skipping straight over the second form and hitting the third perfectly describes him as a character
Ryuo is Wano's philosophy on haki relating it to a flowing energy more than just a solid willpower
So to reach the second stage of use, their technique is let the haki flow into an area instead of focusing it in like with normal imbuing
Presumably it just overflows and starts projecting, and i'm guessing the final form is when it flows so much it goes into the other object entirely and ruptures it
In which case, it fits so well that Luffy poured so much of his heart into that moment, and his haki seemed to follow in kind and broke Hyogoro's collar
I don't really know filler scenes, lol
The second thing I mentioned; the most interesting part of the scene with Kaido and the scabbards is that he saw their attack coming completely
Full on screamed at them that they couldn't hurt him
And yet, he gave 0 defense. No haki, didn't even seem to flex at all
He was just going to let them stab him and is apparently just immune to it, and that's so interesting
Well yeh, I wasn't questioning why he did it lol
But even Big Mom decided to use armament when blocking a hit from Luffy, yet Kaido just takes these things without lifting a finger
He didn't even have to be stabbed, he could've stopped them there lol
But I'm sure did it to make the point that he was invincible, only to get that slap in the face
But the interesting bit is that even in a world filled with haki, there are so few people who exist who can damage him at all that he felt people as strong as Denjiro, Nekomamushi, Inuarashi and Ashura douji couldn't make a scratch on him
Pfft, Kaido full on let himself get stabbed and they got lucky, people can bitch all they want <:LUL:321931602655707136>
kw?
Oh, until Luffy? Yeah, he fought shanks a little
Or, clashed with him in some notable way
Oh, until this chapter?
Yeah, he fought Kid and Luffy
Kid's entire crew, and Luffy
Yeh exactly, he's been hit repeatedly I'm sure
But not by anyone who could actually hurt him lol
The only person we know for sure has even survived is Perospero right now lol
Big Mom washed ashore, that saved her
Just like Luffy
Well, Kaido absolutely could have, with ease
Oh yeh, lmao
But yeah, apparently they fought until they couldn't fight anymore
Unless I'm mistaken, I believe Hawkins explains it to Law
And I'm sure having conqueror's was a huge flag for Kaido
Nah, it's a war
Odds are it'll be almost entirely group skirmishes and maybe one or two 1v1's
Kid?
I don't think Kid knew this second armament tbh
^ that too, it's just filler
so you can assume it was, sure
This was also long before anyone found out about the third stage
So all they would've known is that Rayleigh could project it
'cause we saw that happening back then already
That's exactly why it doesn't matter
Kamui, we got a close up of him smiling way happier than that at the beginning of wano
Yep
Fantastic moment, too
Why would he hurt his hand?
Bruh, I can't break a mountain with my punches
lmao
Why would Rayleigh be hurt punching rubber?
It's not hardened there yeh
Luffy only imbues his arms and legs
It doesn't go across his torso unless he's getting hit in it
She was having a conversation with Oda and dropping just too many spoilers man
Doom did it to protect the integrity of the server <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Not in this show they aren't, lol
Dressrosa was one of the best arcs for introducing the best admiral
Just gonna throw that out there
I've seen some talk about why Fujitora stopped Zoro
Or if Zoro would've beaten Doflamingo or anything
Nah, there's no world where Zoro would've won that fight
'Cause it wasn't for him to win <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Swrml, you forget his week long training arc
In which he went from 5th Emperor's commander to the 6th Emperor <:CrocoKid:487633532907159552>
^
Also the only reason we still have a Zoro
Because let's be real, if Fujitora weren't weighing his options there
Zoro would be in Impel Down
While I don't disagree that he could've, I just like to think Fujitora would've preferred just arresting him than killing him
Because of their earlier exchange, he even felt bad about having to beat them down there rofl
I love him so much, he's the best part of Dressrosa for me
Him and Kyros
...and Sai. And Lao G.
Very happy that Oda introduced him
It's nice to see Smoker's ambition represented by someone who has pretty much the third highest pull in the marines
And can actually get things done
I'm excited to see what else he ends up doing
Yeah, made me realize
If not for the fact that the government covered it up, the Warlords would've been dismantled as soon as Alabasta happened
If that were to happen, then Marineford would never have happened lol
The Summit War wasn't a thing back then, sexy
Because it wasn't just Croc taking over, it's that pirates saved them while the marines were powerless
Showing the warlords were something they couldn't keep in check, and were therefore inherently dangerous
that's why they covered it up with Smoker taking the credit instead
^ I disagree on it being stupid
Def a nice concept
It added so many more layers of depth to the series
Along with the perfect measure for natural world building
Well, to be fair, there's a little nuance there as well
Only two warlords were ever actually bad for the world, and one wasn't invited, he forced his way in lol
Well, three really
'cause Weevil's got one of the highest body counts in the series
But he does it by accident lmao
Moria was one of the most beneficial members
Yeh vegito, they don't know she actually did all that lol
It's not like they excused it
Moria was removing hundreds of pirates from the sea
He was doing the actual job of the warlords, lmao
During Marineford, not after
Or epically wounded them rather
She turns them to stone
Kiiiinda JSG, but I only say kinda because he didn't do much to the world as a warlord
and he took out Ace, which was kind of beneficial
But also not because he caused the Summit War, and that fucked up the New World really hard
<@!274366418223497217> You're right, a good part of having warlords in general was actually to deter other pirates
That's why it was never a question of strength for Blackbeard joining
Or Buggy
Moria only got kicked out when he was publicly defeated

So like
I feel like this would've been such a good thing to do
Just the perfect plan tbh
Have Big Mom jump in, kill Doflamingo and Fujitora
Or die to them, alternatively
And have Kaido blame everything on her instead of Law
<@!274366418223497217> Pfft, details details. <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Also true, lmfao
they did not save that country
they just saved its future <:LUL:321931602655707136>
It kinda was, the whole country was shredded and Fujitora threw all the rubble in the sea lmfao
I don't think they ever addressed that
Tbh archer
There wouldn't have been many of those left either <:KataLUL:562005179571109888>
If not for Fujitora, there would've been almost none of those left in the arc tbh
<@!274366418223497217> Both, but I think we get a scale when we see Pica going for it right?

the only connection to Momo that trumps the general rest of the crew is Luffy's
Everyone else is pretty equal
As much as momonosuke may hang with them all, a perverted affection doesn't trump the fact that Sanji's risked his life for Momonosuke as much as anyone
Being part of the crew in general is all he needs, just like Luffy wasn't the one who helped Kid in Udon
But it still meant a lot because it was Luffy's ally
In fact, it was Raizo, someone Kid had hardly ever even seen before in his life
^
Lots of swordsmen have fruits
Diamante, Pica, Kinemon, Kaku, any gifter swordsman out there
Presumably King
Jack is also somewhat a swordsman
Saving Momonosuke won't be that powerful of a moment imo
Bon Clay's sacrifice was a huge moment, yes
And Galdino helping with Ace was huge, sure
But
That's because the entirety of Marineford was about rescuing Ace
This raid is not about rescuing Momonosuke
That's just an item on the to-do list
Yeh, it's a part of it, and it's something to do
But the powerful moment will be who wins, not who frees Momo when he has hundreds of allies right next to him already
It's been a while because it took a while for the raid to start
But they're not there to save Momonosuke
They're there to kill Kaido
Momo is easy, that's probably the smallest part of this entire ordeal tbh
It's not like they had to cook up this plan just to get him back, like in Marineford
Sure, but Momo being saved is not the powerful moment
And who does it isn't entirely relevant
He can be saved by the Strawhats and samurai together while Luffy is fighting Big Mom, and have the powerful moment be his win
That'd b e awesome
but he just doesn't have to be cut down by someone in particular, that he is rescued at all is more important
Thing is
Momo's a big deal, but he's so overshadowed by everything else in the raid

That this is the only mention of him at all this chapter <:LUL:321931602655707136>
And it's really just an inference at that
Maybe Yamato will end up taking Ulti and Page One together
All of the Flying Six are after her, so it would be a great set up
If Who's Who were stronger than Luffy, he'd already be a commander lol

BUT LIKE. REALLY KAIDO?
It just still tickles me
Kaido for real goes "you were hiding from me!"
Orochi:
I wish we could've seen his face when all 9 scabbards broke through

Yes, Kinemon helped Zoro push it

<@!160778857702490113>
God?
Feel free to boot him if you want, I got no doubts lol
Rofl, I'm not surprised at all that he came back
They didn't even try to give him fingers
Guys, try not to crowd up on someone
<@!334398834815926275> It can easily be misconstrued the other way too though, just trying not to let a mob happen
Ohfuck my bad, it was going to be a mute until he was super toxic
I must have not noticed the 3H in it still lmao
He sent that to me too, and he's also posted the video multiple places in the server, I think someone should have a chat with him lol
Most people in this series do
Akainu didn't have plot armor
He's an admiral
It's his job to be strong enough to fight an Emperor
Why would one be able to kill him in one hit? What kind of balance could there possibly be if they could? <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Hundreds of injuries
And this is an admiral
^ It's not like an admiral had been taken down before that moment
That was Oda telling you this is who these people are lol
Oo dang, are you okay? Just exhausted?
You guys turn this place into it every hour anyway <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Eh, he could be worse
<@!352120879439675392> That was hilarious <:LUL:321931602655707136>
> I've noticed that there's a really common theme of betrayal in Wano. <@!524603876482220093> And funny enough, it's almost completely been on Kaido/Orochi's side lmao
That just seems to be the general theme there, funny enough
For pirates, that is
It's almost universally the negative choice that is the stereotype
Tried to sacrifice Kaido, lmfao
Break week, don't need a place for the extra traffic right now
The Rocks pirates constantly killed each other
"Betrayal" for them would probably be helping each other lol
Not how, just where
Eh, I doubt Whitebeard would even feel the need to make a deal
He was probably the second strongest member of the crew, considering where he went soon after
Or they were just too powerful to arrest
Kaido was actually captured at one point
He may not have gone free after that battle
Well, King
This is a literal suicide mission
They won't die from Sulong, but they did go there specifically to die if they had to against Kaido
They'll just suffocate him with corpses
Easiest victory <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Depends on the smile
There doesn't seem to be a set rule for how a power actually manifests, just the negative side effects
Yeh king, it's a possibility, but I also doubt the moon will be out for the entire fight too
I figure Kaido would let them go for a bit, then block it out at some point
Hell, Big Mom has even more ability to block it out than he does
She could make a full on raging storm if she wanted
Big Mom knows about Sulong already, she'll know exactly what's up
I wouldn't be surprised if Kaido didn't know tho
Drake is a sword member, and he's *in* the raid already
But, trust me, you can look anywhere and find those. People have been wanting any and every character you could possibly name to show up to this fight
They've been trying to get Blackbeard to go somewhere since Dressrosa
Kaido wants war because he's bored lol
zeph
NO.
Doom, how could you forget about Speed? The fastest character in the manga
Jack just has everything going for him <:CrocoKid:487633532907159552>
But why would another member coming convince you that the marines are?
They'd be coming with the marines anyway lol
Gazelleman lacks stamina
Everyone knows it's all about cross country
That's why Sanji's the fastest strawhat and not Luffy <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Break week, we don't need a channel for excess traffic without the excess traffic
It'll be back when needed, we keep an eye on things
It's a secret group in the marines, not a separate organization
So if Sword shows up, then the marines are going in by default
Unless for some reason they only seen the small group
It's the secret organization *of* the marines, yes they are in it lol
Groups like Sword usually do only have a few people in them, relative to the organization
It probably has less than 200 members, I imagine
Why would that be too much?
That'd be .2% of the marines
It's .2%, yes
This is a good bit less than one
The marines have around 100,000 members as of Marineford
Assuming they haven't increased drastically, a group in it with about 200 people would be around .2% of the organization
I don't get the doubt rofl
How many doctors even feature in One Piece to be able to make a list? lmao
I love it when I see shit like
"Top 4 Yonko"
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
It doesn't necessarily mean they are part of it, but they *are* part of the marines

It's not unconfirmed, they are the Marine HQ Sword
The worst arc of One Piece is probably still one of the best arcs in general manga <:LUL:321931602655707136>
I didn't have one in mind, just general praise there
I wish Jango and Fullbody got the Garp training too
Oh man, feel better bud ‚ù§Ô∏è Are you gonna try to get tested soon?
Nah, akainu wouldn't have gotten to the Strawhats before Kuma could save them
<@!380840459641159683> I figured Rayleigh would just get to run sooner is all, but the den den mushi is a good point lmao

Are commands case sensitive?
Zoro's a 1-3 sword style user, yeh
Santoryuu is just his strongest
Dax, there's a really good chance it's a temporary effect lol
She can probably only do it for long enough to chain someone up, not permanently
But also, she makes them weak and worthless
So if it's permanent, they're useless after <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Kinda like a nicer version of Kalifa's fruit, thinking about it
Oh no, I was just saying he has styles from 1-3 lol
I thought you were asking why anyone thought he had a two sword, lmao
That's something to ask in <#164971940648321024> more so than here, but it's just gone until we have a need for it
Break week for the manga and all
üëçüèæ
<@!373144491005313025> I can't recall, was it a mistranslation that he went for the level 6 people?
^
I can see that yeh
Yeh, they were the ones who caused Sengoku to resign
Because the government wanted to cover up so many people left level 6 but weren't with blackbeard
What a year that week was for him
There could have been, curiosity
they didn't have their own cells
They were chained in groups
Pfft when's the last time a president fought a war in office? <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Well, they wanted to keep sengoku and Garp to help raise the next generation
But Sengoku and Garp were particularly high profile people too
The marines are actually doing very well
That was driven home after the time skip
Apparently they're stronger than ever
That's such a big thing and it doesn't get enough recognition, wow
They can make Pacifistas
They can now manufacture armies of Warlord worthy poeple
Yeah, honestly that's probably one of the biggest things they brought out at Marineford
Nothing about it is confirmed except that it's Vegapunk's thing, mip
^
Kizaru's fruit is just a laser
So they could probably just shoot fire or freeze things too
Maybe even shoot molten metal or something
Like that's not even really copying a fruit power
It's just giving them flamethrowers and nitrogen guns <:LUL:321931602655707136>
That would be such a bad idea, wow lmao
Even if they only get the downside, that's still kind of terrifying
A smiling cyborg coming to kill you with a giant laser lmao
But, if they get the powers
Imagine the ones with sentient parts <:LUL:321931602655707136>
All the chapter day and rule commands, lol
There is no difference between Kuma before and after he lost his mind, that we know
There is not lol
He really didn't seem able to
Bigblue, can you provide pages to indicate this sentiment?
That's literally what I just asked you to do <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Nope, you can grab pages
No scenes lmao
You cannot
No, and no other series references pls
If you can't provide scans and panels, it's not a supported argument rofl
Hang on, work call
No it's not, the anime can't clarify the original source lmao
It is not lol
Pasta's right i'm js
What do they think doing these things will accomplish?
Give us something to do in the day? lol
Who said Roger couldn't beat him?
rofl
We eating fire in here?
His head being fine doesn't mean Roger didn't beat the shit out of him, tho
Lao G didn't break his head and still beat him
Garp's the one we know for sure couldn't <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Nah, just that it's his most important weapon
Dude was more than capable of throwing a great punch too lol
jamon...jamon...jamon...jamon...
Nep*tyooon*
But that's not a fact, that's your estimation
We don't know that Roger ever even tried
Now, what we do know for sure
Is that Garp didn't use nearly the level of haki on Chinjao that Roger used on Whitebeard
And yet, Garp still couldn't beat him until then
No, it was training lmao
I love that apologizing for him tho <:LUL:321931602655707136>
He himself points out that he does it so that he can break Chinjao's horn
You assume Roger couldn't, vegito
But we know for a fact Garp couldn't
We also know for a fact Roger and Whitebeard were the strongest <:LUL:321931602655707136>
No, I'm just not claiming one way or the other
It makes perfect sense that he didn't try to, tho
Luffy didn't even try until the very last hit of their match
Because he wouldn't need to?
If he can blow away Chinjao without even touching his horn, why go through the trouble?
Yeah, and beating down Chinjao and his entire crew is plenty fun
^
You're assuming they fought at all <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Yeh, let's grab some panels
This was a magazine thing tho
https://i.redd.it/rqxvofp25jx41.jpg
This is the whole page, and disclaimer, I cannot read Japanese to save my life
But, I do not see Roger's picture here, and I haven't seen a mention of him in a translation for this yet
Someone help source pls
Yeh, I believe it only recaps the fight and adds how Garp couldn't beat Chinjao before the training, but they'd fought a few times before
Oh, apparently they fought before Roger was even the King
lmao
30 years back
Well...it is lol
This is piracy
<@!211762789109334016> wassup lucy
LOOOOL

Nux Taku is the most annoying, shallow minded dude I've ever seen on youtube
That's not saying much, I don't watch many youtubers
Especially One Piece ones
But ugh
Dude was never funny to me, rofl
He feels like a neckbeardier artur to me
I love reviews more than theorists
He's useful for extra material translations if they're accurate, for sure
Does he fil? I haven't heard any yet <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Ehh I don't really do podcasts either
I'm not opposed, but I don't like shallow theories
They don't have to be correct or even plausible, just something with a little more thought than
"Zoro's gonna unlock conqueror's haki in Wano CONFIRMED!"
No, middle east?
I'll brb tho

ohbutwhydontthemarineskilltheemperorstholul
I'd prefer if you guys wanted to keep talking about the series to do so in <#513312224048185345> just in case, dunno if anyone's reading that <@!196038600565981185>
No clue what it is tho
It was a joke about that panel, mip <:LUL:321931602655707136>
The balance is important to the government for a reason

I just realized
That's San Juan Wolf
Wolf? Probably, I remember there was that panorama when Magellan mentioned Whitebeard and everyone wanted him dead there
His fruit lets him increase his size
That'd be his actual size
Ages ago, vivre card I think?
Well, he sank it, so not well <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Or, broke it anyway
Well, they didn't steal a ship, that was something blackbeard regretted
They tried to barter a ship for him lol
^ It was probably Garp
Apparently they all had a grudge against Whitebeard too, so it could've even just been clean up after a fight with him lol
No, the one who put the people in level 6
Not helping bonney rofl
I imagine it's between Garp, Sengoku and the current admirals
Half birthday, lmao
ffffffffff birthdays
I do, and I will explain why in a sec <@!107217661628301312>
<@!107217661628301312> Aight sorry, work call. So I don't think Kaido's got as much of an information network as Big Mom only because his people don't seem as organized as she's been so far
For example, he somehow didn't even know Kinemon and the Scabbards were still around despite Doflamingo fighting them directly
Though he does seem to have a bunch of underworld connections and deals going on, I think he's got the funding side more than the recon side
Maybe similar in scope as far as having a similarly large group of territories, I could see that
But maybe not as dedicated, since Big Mom even has homies who can pass things to napoleon and straight to her
Oh yeh, she's got it on lock. But she's also unique with the homies advantage, so they may do like a rough version
But she's a little broken as far as that goes
#sab4admin

Well yeah, 'cause everyone's screaming about him being invulnerable now <:LUL:321931602655707136>
lmao
Oh yeh, are you guys up for games today?
i'm off in about 3 hours, but I have the night off
Dragon/dark
Doom
The entire first half of the series had them going island to island for no reason at all, and the very first island in the New World, they went to for no reason
Just wanting to go because Usopp wants to is more than enough reason, lol
Yeh, the log, not plot
Punk Hazard, they did go to for no reason
It was literally just because it seemed the most dangerous, and therefore most fun, to Luffy
And then from there, rest of the next decade was set, lol
They went to Punk Hazard because of the call, and because it seemed dangerous to them
Yes, like I said
Because it seemed dangerous and therefore the most fun to Luffy <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Oh true pasta, Alabasta they did go to for a reason
forgot that was basically the first round of Punk Hazard --> Dressrosa
Yeh mip exactly
if Luffy wants to go, they'll go, they've never *needed* a reason
Not at all
Nothing ends when they find One Piece except the race to find it
Luffy still has to adventure around, and Elbaf is important to some degree
But also, yeh, all he has to do is want to go
Not like there's a time limit for getting to Laugh Tale
That'd be interesting, vain
Minus the death lmao
Kinemon would stand no chance against Doflamingo
That he can seemingly use a new form of haki doesn't mean he can suddenly take people who don't seem to know it
> I mean we did get a sneak peek of that directly outside the colosseum bean, where doffy wrecked kin <@!142923564423577601> Oh yeh, I forgot that lmao
Is TheOriginalLuffy BDA? They post the new video in promote yourself every time it's out
The inherited haki is probably exactly what it is tbh
Especially given this series' insistence on inherited will being a driving force for people
Not like he bestowed it, but they're picked up his dream and it's molded their haki to be as great as his was
Non-ryuo attacks can work on them
It's just really, really, *really*  hard
Could have, sure vegito
No reason they couldn't
Luffy could've easily broken the collar
The problem was it would've gone off before he could take care of it lol
Yeh laww, I had a little essay about that yesterday I think
How it's nice that Wano's philosophy in swordsmanship is built on nuance and subtlety over straight power
Luffy was used to having to concentrate his haki and punch with his fist
As opposed to just letting it flow to an area
Yes gaime
Of course, lmao
<@!274366418223497217> Y'know, he does mention it back when Luffy does it, but I don't think he ever goes back to that theory after Sabaody lol
Now, there is a *heavy* bit of evidence that it was the higher form of it
There's just no completely direct confirmation is all
Oh yeh zeph, is he doing the post-war arc tomorrow too?
Or just Marineford?
wtffffff
Just do to it justice?
Guys, One Piece chat here pls
<#513312224048185345> If you wanna talk about Avatar's development
Well yeah
His crew is just made of people he beat
lol
I love it lmao
Yes kazuma
It is as of Marineford, anyway
Why would that be foolish? It's not like we know what Blackbeard wants at all
All we know is he wants fruits, having to fight Big Mom for one isn't worth it
Like, the Kage Kage does almost just as well anyway
At Water 7, Garp's crew knew about it
At Marineford, it was announced to everyone
Not that Dragon is Garp's son, but that he's Luffy's father
And everyone knows Garp is Luffy's grandfather, so 2 and 2
No, Whitebeard was actually a huge thing for him
He admired him for his strength, and seemed to want to be him
It was, he wanted the strength he'd admired for years
The Gura Gura was the key to it
And he killed him to declare his age
<@!319602380041879552> No, you misunderstood
I mean he told them at Water 7, no one actually knew before then
and at Marineford, *everyone* knew because they were told
And it's easy to put together that Luffy's dad is probably Garp's son
No, he did it for a personal reason too. It wasn't just a dispassionate killing, he grew disappointed in Whitebeard's decline of power and wanted to usurp him
Ace was nothing personal, Whitebeard was his entire goal before getting to be an Emperor himself
Some people didn't even think Dragon existed until recently
The Archipelago was actually right next door lol
That's why it was so dangerous to be uppity around for pirates, and why Kizaru could get there so fast
Right as he's assaulting him, hang on

<@!155760010410983424> Yeah, it didn't have to be personal, he just made it personal. But everything he did was in reference to Whitebeard's age being over and all, if it were anyone it would've been the same, but he was looking to take that seat from Whitebeard
^ also yeh lmao
Even though Sentoumaru and some Pacifistas can show up
<@!390376167636467722>

It'd be A
What's that?
I can see why that would be a compelling argument marc
But I would think that in that situation, you really would be fine
Yeh, relativity plays into this lol
I'm gonna have to think about this for a sec, but I wanna still say A
I can see how it would be both tho
Mkay, so it would be A
And here's my reasoning
In the dick example, there's a structure that is still moving through the portal
So relatively speaking, the thing is basically coming out of the ground at 1 million miles an hour through the other side. But with the cube, there's nothing acting past it going into the portal, so it should just kind of plop out but not fly out, I feel
And since there's no big difference in motion between the two frames, I don't think there would be enough energy in either to have it flying off
As opposed to someone pretty much running themselves through with a sword lmao
But then, I really can see it going B as well for the exact opposite reason too lmao
I'm gonna stick with A based on that tho, there just doesn't feel like there are enough factors to make it go flying versus just a quick piddle off
Yeh, energy is relative, so that does make sense
And if the portal were going fast enough, I can see it falling a good distance, but I don't think it would full on fly off
Especially since gravity is changing vectors for it
Yeh, it'd be B, relativity really plays into it lol
It's all relativity, looking at it I wanna treat it like you're just putting a circle over the box
But it actually is moving through space
Or, space is moving through it rather, which amounts to literally the same thing
Yeh, I wanna say someone thought of that problem before too
But like before the game Portals was made
Youss is right
And yes, just don't talk about the content in other channels
And preferably stay in the manga channels more than others
You mean inconclusive?
Being as accurate to IRL as we can be, and assuming this is the standard definition of a portal
It'd have to be B
Yeh, if portal mechanics are the equivalent of just throwing a hula hoop over something, then it stays still
If it's an actual bending of space and time, that creates momentum and energy from a certain reference frame
Fun fact, that's one of the theoretical secrets to FTL travel
Yeh, you've gone faster than light to everyone looking at you
but, to you yourself, you've only taken a step over a threshold
So there's no violation of physics
You can't go the speed of light in your own reference frame
You can't exceed it in anyone's reference frame unless you've got a time machine
I wanna say yes, but not because of time dilation there

Goddammit.
It's there somewhere.'
Buggy's crew included the many, many people he had working under him as mercernaries
Which included over 200 high level prisoners from Impel Down
I feel like that'll be Buggy's first safe refuge if he has to stay in the New World
Begrudgingly, extremely begrudgingly
To be fair, they thought they killed him
<@!96965684428283904> We do know the power relation, Jack was about even with both of them
He couldn't beat them any more than they could beat him
That's reinforced when Jack does to fight Ashura Douji in Wano and goes toe to toe with him, and later Inuarashi and Ashura Douji are confirmed equal as well
They weren't weaker than Jack
That's why he couldn't beat them, either lol
Yeah, for the most part it does
This wasn't like a gimmicky fight where you need to pay attention to context or anything
This was a straight up brawl between two straightforward fighters
And Jack couldn't put either of them down after 12 hours of fighting either of them
It's driven home even further in Wano, Oda's kind of gone out of his way to frame where Jack is in relation to the scabbards
Because Inuarashi,  Nekomamushi and Ashura Douji were all confirmed as strong as him, indirectly and directly
They didn't have to take breaks at all
They *chose* to
The option was brought up not to take breaks and keep on fighting, they chose their cycles over Jack's invasion
Like, I have 0 doubt at all that Inuarashi and Nekomamushi can fight for multiple days as well
As powerful as they are, when potentially much weaker characters have
If Jack were going to win at the last hour, he would have won the very next fight
Clearly he could not damage them enough to actually tip the fight in his favor at al
That, and the whole 1v1 instead of 2v1 on him
rofl
Nah, the full moon was a good week away
'cause it doesn't happen until WCI
Diddy you're disagreeing with a fact here lol
Unless Jack just decided to hold back, anyway
Doen, please.
there are 12 moons
Oh no, the going for a week is based on my own estimation. Everything else is based on direct statement or inference from the series
And literally all signs point to them being even, and that was reiterated in Wano lol
It is a fact, tho
hang on, lemme grab some pages
About a week to WCI

I like how Luffy makes it sound like the dukes fought Batman or something lmao
Gear 5th lmao
He fought them one at a time and could not take them out
What are you talking about lmao
It's not possible, mip
Inuarashi alludes to looking forward to being able to use it against Jack next time
And the full moon happens just about a week later, in WCI
inb46moons
But yeh, they were approaching it, but hadn't gotten to it just yet
But we know without it, Jack couldn't beat them
He was about even with them, according to the series
So with it, they probably would wreck him
Unless he has some augmentation he didn't actually use against them
I hope we don't get some shit like Jack was holding back his strongest form against the dukes
lmao
goddammit doen rofl
I hope Luffy one shots Jack
-mute 733869674160193537 10m
Come on now.
So it looks like there's a fire growing near me, and I may have to evac but no one's told us yet
But if so, I may be gone the next few days, I'll still have my phone so I'll keep you guys posted
Really hoping we don't have to 'cause I have a cat and that makes it a little harder, since my roomie can't take her <:crocoSweat:674289849314050098>
It's at 25 acres and 10% contained apparently, I'm not sure how good those numbers are but I've seen thousands of acres burned so here's hoping lmao
Sakazuki is probably the head of Sword because he's the Fleet Admiral, lol
If you mean Sakazuki's comment on them, it doesn't really make sense in general
Since reporting in at all would mean the marines would find out
So either there's no real way of indicating their strength to him or he's not really there to report on it, so he doesn't
It's been super windy over here lately, but it seems like they got to it early enough that it's not too bad
thankfully
Adam, what I was saying before was that if the samurai of Wano were a key issue as far as a decision Sakazuki had to make
By now, he'd know exactly how strong they are if that's information Drake's supposed to be getting
Whether he leads Sword or not
Yes, but he's the Fleet Admiral
Just by the fact that Drake knows these things, he should know
It's not like Sword would be doing things independently of Sakazuki's benefit entirely, it's a marine group
So somehow the fleet admiral didn't get information from Sword?
I feel like it's more likely that Drake just can't accurately relay the strength of the samurai beyond numbers
No, I'm asserting Drake just doesn't have the information to give, if he does there's no way Sakazuki wouldn't know about it
But how? This isn't like a government agency not giving information to the president, this is a military group within a military group
Their chain of command, as far as we can possibly tell, ends at Sakazuki
Like, this is *his* group
Yeh, so Cipher Pol keeping info from the marines and vice versa makes sense
Those are two different groups who may even be softly at odds in a lot of ways
But this is a group only Sakazuki could be in charge of, in an ultimate sense
Unless somehow they report only to Kong or something?
Which is a possibility still, I can't disregard it, but I feel like it's unlikely
So far no word on the website for how, I'm guessing it was someone hiking and throwing out a cigarette or something though
It was in a high traffic recreational hiking area
But it wasn't numbers they didn't know, it was the strength of those numbers
But also, Drake may not have that information
Orochi is under no obligation to share how many samurai he has under him
Not a big secret, just information no one's cared to get, so no one really has
It just seems extremely unlikely that a group within the marines is operating without any total line of information to Sakazuki
Even if not directly, just by being a marine group and having the knowledge, it's impossible for Sakazuki to not be getting it
Because otherwise, wtf would they possibly be doing with what they gather? rofl
But the problem is, if Drake has the information and it's *not* getting to Sakazuki
What use is it at all?
For what? If another admiral has it, now would be the time that Sakazuki gets it
What could an admiral do with that information that Sakazuki couldn't?
Really, why would they be keeping it from him even now when this is a specific piece of info he needs?
How would they know?
They don't just watch Sakazuki 24/7 rofl
^
But also, if the marines aren't using the info, why is it even being gathered?
It's clearly not a government branch, so it's not like they're leaking it to the Gorosei
It kind of does though
And if they are without his input, they're heavily, *heavily* nerfing themselves
Because no matter who the head of that group is, Sakazuki has more power and more resources
That's really all it comes down to for me, why would they weaken themselves so hard by not giving Sakazuki everything they have when he can then swing everything *he* has at the issue?
Acting independently of the marines a few times is wholly different than an entirely separate organization being run
Or that's just information that Drake doesn't know
he's part of Kaido's crew after all, not Orochi's gang
He's reporting on the piracy, not the samurai
Yeah, but the marines haven't been able to get it
I'm sure they're more interested in the fact that Kaido is there, and Oden is from there
The only sensible thing to me is that they just don't have the info yet more so than Sakazuki somehow can't access it
They tried, choc
Ages back, Ryuma was apparently a big factor in stopping them
But that's why they know they can't do it, presumably
I'm sure now would be different, between Kaido sucking the resources of the land and people away and the marines getting the Pacifistas and SSG
You'd think you'd know better by now <:LUL:321931602655707136>
That's how it goes a good bit of the time, the most power hungry folks usually end up being destroyed by their greed
We've confirmed that death releases the fruit, and that seems to be their goal either way
Judging by Devon's word, Burgess's actions, and blackbeard not being able to take Ace's fruit while he was alive
Literally no matter which two fruits he gets, that we know in the series, if he has two at once he'll probably be stronger than most others lol
Well, he advanced faster than Luffy could've ever dreamed of with it, so that's fun
Probably faster than anyone ever has tbh lol
Thing is, Marco's words are what kind of put that idea down
He pretty clearly indicated they had no plans or anything involving Wano the entire time
Which makes sense, not like pirates visit their friends constantly in this series, people go decades without seeing each other
If they were a particular problem for him, maybe
It was implied to be destroyed completely

Seems that it was both taken off maps and actually destroyed itsel
No, Whitebeard and Roger's clash was nowhere near island destroying
But, it did cause enough collateral damage that it uprooted trees, sent the crews flying and almost capsized the Moby Dick lol
^ They'll probably skip it
Since the only reason to go there seemed to be to find out what they did at Zou
It also seems that God Valley was destroyed, since Sengoku mentioned that it was both taken off maps *and* disappeared entirely
Even Ohara didn't get that rep
^
They really didn't seem to be holding back there either
they almost toppled Whitebeard's ship and sent a *lot* of folks flying lmao
^
You just find out about the poneglyphs yeh
Roger got there, revised his trip, and *then* headed straight for Laugh Tale
they didn't need to go to Lodestar again for it
Nah, they actually address this during Marineford
Whitebeard's crew just knows not to get in his way and protect themselves from him
So he's able to attack freely
Also yeh, they both loved a good fight
^ And technically, as much as they were friends, they were still enemies and the only rivals each other had
And being that this was the last time Roger could ever fight Whitebeard, I imagine he'd have wanted to make it memorable
After all, 3 days and nights of fighting is no light clash rofl
lmao
!purge 29
<@!228271420445163521> Lmao I thought you meant Whitebeard vs Roger up there too
Nah, there seemed to be the implication that shiki was comparable to Roger at least, if not as strong
Well, not as strong, we know that rofl
But Roger probably couldn't just one shot him, all things considered
Yes illu
Artur just put it out today <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Well, the weather was a lucky turn of events
It looked like it was brewing before the fight started, I think?
Eh, it kinda makes more sense for it to be
Only because it was a fight in the New World, after all
That kind of thing is normal
Not even like a freak incident or anything, you almost expect it lol
Lmao, I mean maybe somehow he did
Or even the egg did, idk
Sensed he was in danger of dying and causedit
Hey, you never know lmao
Yeh
I'm serious tho, that could be a thing
Maybe it was some kind of weather manipulating bird or something?
The whole reason the Grandline's weather is all fucked up
Kind of like how Fishmen can change ocean currents
So hyped about it
It's dropping soon yc
In half an hour?
12 EST I wanna say
I'm at work now, ugh
I'm waiting to take my break so I can start it lol
Pffft, not like an arc in One Piece? Have you seen his reviews? <:LUL:321931602655707136>
<@!107217661628301312> I'd be tired of it more if not for knowing that this really is his first read through
It is getting tiring that literally every arc but Thriller Bark has been escalating as his greatest manga reading experience ever
But I also really appreciate the sheer shock and awe he's displaying at it
Like it's validating why everyone loves the series instead of only hyping the cliche, power scaling or shounen tropes of it
Yeh, each and every arc except for Thriller Bark has been far better than the previous one for him
<@!380840459641159683> That was my greatest fear too
Hated that he started talking about the weirdest things for Moria
Like him giving up shadows was because he lost a battle of wills with the shadows?
Goddammit audience
He knows about Ace
He's already finished Marineford and the post-war arc
This vid is about Marineford, then the next will be for the post-war and I imagine return to Sabaody
But honestly, as short as the post-war arc is, there is SO much that goes on you could easily do a whole video on it
Oh it will evan
FMI and Thriller Bark will be his only disliked arcs
Yeh, the powers bit about Moria, I didn't care about at all for him
I just dislike that he focused on it and not Moria's development as a character and his motivations
Because those are touched on in the arc, and Moria's entire set of actions and techniques are all inspired by his fucked up PTSD mindset
Yeh, he mentioned it for a second, but all of his corrections fell right back onto why the final fight's conclusion was okay
Versus what he missed in the narrative
I'm not sure if he rates the arcs, does he?
Some do
Most don't
Moria's doesn't
So, Moria releases the shadows for two evident reasons
The first, out of spite
That's the least obvious one, since he seems to indicate that himself
The second, because he took too many in, was barely conscious, slightly deranged and was getting them beaten out of him
Like, he ate too much and started spewing them up because he couldn't keep them in check
Since he was damn near dead by then, really
But yeh, he didn't *have* to let them out
And when he gets the shadows, he has automatic total control over them, he can't really lose a battle of wills against the shadows lol
Did he YC? I didn't even notice that one, i'll have to go back
Nah, Zoro was running *to* pica
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOVzo4Vnc-w
<@!421882805702623263>
Oh, he said he'd be skipping the post war lol
i'm happy
Oh shit
50  minute video
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
So he gave plenty of time
lmao same pasta
ay otp
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOVzo4Vnc-w
If anyone is interested
Tbh, Marineford goes by so fast
even though it really is a full arc
so a reread for me only ever takes like a day lol
Marineford had buildup over 5 different arcs, coded
lol
It's probably the most built up event in the series second to the raid at Wano
Marineford had its own build up stage, it's just the build up happened elsewhere
Okay I have to watch it now
I just can't not ugh
I'll have to just split it up between calls, dangit
They purposefully won't catch up
At worst we may have a couple of filler episodes like Water 7, that's about it
Bubbles?
Speech bubbles?
Yeh, Luffy's absolutely not getting higher than Roger
Maybe he'll leap over Shanks and Blackbeard, that's about the highest I can see being generous
It's almost an hour long
So that'll be a commitment
Just so you know, lol
Roger died before there *were* two Emperors to take down
lol
We also don't know if Shanks never did
Blackbeard, in fact, did take down an Emperor
And is the only Emperor known to have done so in his time
But two? I doubt Luffy's taking down two
Hell, I doubt Luffy's taking down one tbh, lmao
There's an entire alliance and a nation fighting here, Luffy's the most famous player to the outside world but not even the most important party here
But also remember, Law and Luffy got credit for Dressrosa equally
Hour long almost, doom
lmao
Doom
The FMI video will just be 10 minutes of Mark being pissed
"Hello, my name is TotallyNotMark, and Oda what the fuck did you do to Sanji?!"
I'm on and off between calls watching it
I'll give input after work when I can do it all at once again
Can you put a timer on the kick?
For something like that, a few days gone would be a good message
The way it flows off of his hair and skin is perfect, jeff
Oh yeh, I support a timed ban over a kick in that case
I thought we could kick for a soft ban on a timer
Neither
Because honestly, Akainu didn't really do *that* much to them
For Sabo, it should be a non issue, as devastating as it is it was a marine doing his job
He didn't put a hole through their chests, lol
Akainu being the one to do it shouldn't factor in as much
Do you think they'd have wanted revenge on the no name executioners if it happened without him?
Yeh, Luffy would have a much stronger grudge against Blackbeard than Akainu
Sakazuki just did his job, it was a completely impersonal killing really
Well, Spandam went out of his way to get Robin, and did some extremely underhanded things that personally damaged Franky at least
that's some stuff I imagine would get some revenge
but what Spandam did was basically Blackbeard's role in Marineford
Well, when I say personal I mean there was no history between them beyond the fact that Sakazuki had a pirate to kill
Like, personal between the people involved, not just a personal drive
As opposed to Blackbeard, who did all of that with betrayal in the start
Nah, Akainu hates them about the same, he just recognizes their danger
He doesn't even seem to hate them, I'd even call that too personal
He just seems to hate law breakers and they happened to be some
I don't know if I'd call even that personal
'cause *everyone* was hating them for it
I mean, it's Roger and Dragon
the fact that they exist is literally all the reason needed
You're not wrong, fats
Srsly
nah, Blackbeard wouldn't have even become an Emperor before dying
The only reason he managed to get as far as he did was because whitebeard wasn't around to stop him
Kaido and Big Mom would never have met again on good terms
since Luffy's the reason they're coming together <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Pre-skip I always used to say if you took the strawhats out, you'd still be able to have a full world turning without them and a complete plot and everything
Oda's worldbuilding was that good
But now, Luffy's grown so big I can't even say that anymore
Almost everything going on now is a direct consequence of something he's done, even as far as what's going on at Reverie
Or, what went on rather
^
Every single thing going on since FMI has been directly related to Luffy's own actions
Yeh doom, the Worst Generation are the only other characters who could carry the series now
And it'd be *radically* different to today's stuff
^
Not even the biggest tbh, more the most connected
So as soon as he turns, *soooo* many more do
He's 15 in mind lmao
honestly fats, Oda draws attention to that himself
Just by how many people liken him to Roger
*The* manliest man of all goddamn time
Whitebeard was the daddiest of men, sys
Roger was the manliest
And together, they were the greatest of all men <:LUL:321931602655707136>
