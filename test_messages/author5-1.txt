Nah lower
‚ÄúBeat‚Äù
Some glory will go to big mom assuming kaido dies
> Katakuri pirates ftw <@!439770223944400896>  more like peros pirates
Why would the WG kill a yonkou
Both kaido and BM have plans to betray each other
It‚Äôs obvious
They‚Äôll use each other
No other reason
> yes they need eachother to beat luffy alliance so they cant betray <@617706789852545034>  what ?!! They don‚Äôt need help against the alliance lol
It‚Äôs that they need each other. It‚Äôs just that fighting over road poneglyphs will kill them both so they teamed up
No shanks has none
One in zou one with bm one with kaido (apparently)
Does shanks know where Rafael is ? I don‚Äôt think he went there tho
<@429648668648407040> actually he‚Äôs giving her that look because the word she uses to say ‚Äúslaughter‚Äù means beating someone repeatedly until they die
Yeah he‚Äôs over bm lol
Yeah
Mega hype
I doubt bb would show up. Maybe marines tho
Bb is looking for something remember
Saying if the wg won‚Äôt take it then he will
> I think one of the most frustrating things of being a OP fan is. Trying to get your friends to watch it <@429648668648407040>  unless you have no friend like me
People watch shows for the ending but op is a journey
Yeah could be pluton
Lots of ancient weapon mention lately
Bb is smart so he doesn‚Äôt need to fight much
Yeah he needs power to achieve his goals but he rarely fights himself
No idea lol
I think op has a good 7 years left
God valley movie would be amazing
Where does greenbull come in play tho
Yeah current pace is scary tbh
Anime is still fun tho
Anime and manga work together
Yeah manga first but anime is made for manga watchers hence the spoilers in openings
So both is good
Me too
Obviously manga is the main source for the story
Aren‚Äôt the main points the same in the anime. Except for fights
I still enjoyed dressrosa in the anime
Chopper footsteps sound great tho
> Why do i feel like Weevil will body Queen <@328936254978916352>  because he will
Wano faces have been great too
Am I the only one who doesn‚Äôt rewatch that much
I feel like khan is too much tbh
Anyone follows the one piece virgin
It‚Äôs a podcast
Nux and gang
Really good
I can never understand reactions
Only reviews make sense to me
> I don‚Äôt understand watching for the reactions <@!420202273885519872>  human nature and confirmation bias
Telling us gibberish but lots of fun
Brago and grandline are my go tos
Grandline is reasonable
Lol I‚Äôm the only Managua reader in my family tree
What a creepy about that
Tf is magu Chan
Bon voyage
Last few ops were fire
Zoro king‚Äôs haki thoughts
Me too. Lots of hints
It‚Äôs not vice captain stuff. Remember shabondy
Where did we see his full strength
> Sanji coc is possible because hes from royalty <@739154454871277668>  you understand the word ‚Äúking‚Äù wrong mah dude
Pica was 10 years ago lol
CBR is the best lol
Monet underrated wifu
> Top 10 one piece slice of life moments <@!460071803331674113>  you work for watchmojo bro
Hell yeah
I didn‚Äôt give a shit about ace dying
I was actually happy because it makes the story good
Merry was kinda sad
Toki talking to oden before the boiling was mega sad
I felt for luffy but I didn‚Äôt care about ace
Ace had to die tho
I understand why people cry about ace but I just didn‚Äôt care
Ace had potential
Luffy‚Äôs shock was great when ace died
No one‚Äôs hating lol
Just opinions
Ace was cool but didn‚Äôt do much
He was a device
WB‚Äôs crew was a family so they had no problem dying
Are colored chapters available as physical volumes
Damn
Using numbers of deaths as logic doesn‚Äôt work because they are willing to sacrifice themselves for each other
Yeah mega sulong hype
Shit I forgot about bepo
No he only got damaged because of oden ptsd
Btw does carrot wear a glove
Why the glove tho
Now way kanjuro is amazing
They were seconds way from war what‚Äôre you talking about
People can have their opinions lol it‚Äôs a discussion not a fight
Big brain kin
Anyone still doesn‚Äôt trust hiyori
The thing with ryuou is that it‚Äôs what wano people call advanced haki so maybe the haki users if wano are stronger in terms of haki
Bro it‚Äôs called ryuou not ryou I read the Japanese
> But you dont say Mantra for Future Sight either <@!283276421470748673>  maybe it is idk
Haki naming scheme is weird now
> 5th emperor was literally a chapter title <@328936254978916352>  what chapter was it
For the 5th yonkou thing. In Japanese it‚Äôs meant as the 5th in order not as part of a group. It says the 5th emperor not ‚Äúthe 5th four emperors‚Äù
Probably one of the roger crew still has it
They still had to come back from raftel
Where tf did sanji go btw
I‚Äôm still confused
He disappeared at the black Maria ‚Äúhouse‚Äù
Oden‚Äôs flashback is top tier
Franky is and lucky
She hella expensive
One piece power scalers are too much
> <@564773067969265674> u didnt see naruto power scalers then <@606196171307745308>  don‚Äôt remind me please
Swagkage talking about them is enough to know to stay away
Nah madara was fire
You better be
Duck one piece yeah
Kaido with his ptsd is weird
Hopefully it won‚Äôt lewd to his loss
Auto correct is the main one piece villain
Honestly saying op is mid is more triggering than sucks
This server is weird
Law is too innocent to be subjected to the straw hats
Why no oden emotes tho
> üç¢ <@272064319661801473>  mega funny dude
Oh shit yeah
Kidd
What‚Äôs your favorite op hentai
You into vanilla nah dude
Remember when he wrapped his neck around her
Nah she smart not a digger
She blackmailed vivi and others so she‚Äôs not very nice
She even blackmailed momo
> <@564773067969265674> she's like a coconut <@679552742343180331>harf to get into but nice inside
How tf did bb hurt shanks tho
> <@!564773067969265674> blackmailed how? <@272064319661801473>  not blackmailed but I forgot the word. She asked for money to help her
Why is Yamato‚Äôs gender even a debate
I know nami is nice I‚Äôm just kidding chill
You‚Äôre in discord
Angry chopper is too cute
Nami the capitalist
> pre ts at least <@703504844903940096>  tf is that supposed to mean
> <@564773067969265674> luffy is a communist <@679552742343180331>  nah he wants all the meat
> Pre timeskip chopper <@703504844903940096>  yeah ik but why is post ts not cute
Idk haven‚Äôt read about communism so I can‚Äôt say
Pre ts chopper looked homeless yet cute
Everything fails bc of greed and corruption tho
Yeah franky in choppers body made her mad
Pre ts robin is the best
Nah still is
She‚Äôs cute still but she felt human pre ts
It‚Äôs just robin jeez
She did pre ts too
Panda man was in law‚Äôs crew in one panel
Panda woman in Amazon Lilly too
What about when she was a kid
This debate is pointless
Robin us robin
Nah it‚Äôs just oden ptsd
They‚Äôre not that strong tho
There was a sub just for chopper porn but I forgot the name
> <@564773067969265674> Neko and Inu were able to stalemate Jack. They‚Äôre strong. Also, them all being Oden‚Äôs disciples? Their combined force to be equal to Oden makes perfect sense <@313446774628941824>  it‚Äôs mostly ryuou and I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre not strong just not that strong
Some people say that oden‚Äôs ryuou was trapped inside kaido‚Äôs scar
Pants are for the weak
> <@703504844903940096> Someone pointed out that each of their favorite foods was an ingredient that goes into Oden (the food), and that all of them combined created it. Each Scabbard has a sliver of Oden‚Äôs will/strength, so them combining forces to temporarily equal their master makes sense <@313446774628941824>  you‚Äôre too deep in the rabbit hole  bro
Theories are no fun imo just enjoy the story
I Stan croco mom
My favorite is that dragon isn‚Äôt luffy‚Äôs father
Who tf ships robin and luffy
I can‚Äôt see it
I ship brook and chopper
> <@564773067969265674> die <@!390543442335236127>  bro I burst out laughing thx
> choniki sounds retarded too <@!285327673553846272>  nah it‚Äôs hella cute
Carrot‚Äôs va sounds hella cute tho
> or i am assuming it got reduced , its not like i vist *those* sites <@690158729685106749>  yeah you don‚Äôt
Post enies lobby
She fucked up sanji after the bathhouse
What‚Äôs with the forehead
I still mistake Yamato‚Äôs face for nami
Female design is weird in op
What‚Äôs even that Island
Jeez I need to reread
Anyone think that brook and robin are awakened
Brook can leave his body tho
It‚Äôs lit called the soul fruit
Why would he need to do that
He has full control of his soul
That would be too op
Fuck ace
I think both robin and brook  are awakened since they got much more powerful after the ts
Peros wants to be captain so Marco can help stop big mom
> <@!564773067969265674> Luffy also got better at the properties of his fruit. I still see awakening as something else <@!415999229564157955>  brook can leave his body and just be a soul and robin can make another body. Luffy didn‚Äôt do anything this significant
Thatd s be cool
Gura gura king king gun
I still don‚Äôt know how akainu survived
What‚Äôs kalifa‚Äôs fruit called then
Is that the sound of bubbles in Japanese?
But akainu tanking whiteberad‚Äôs hit to the head is bs
> think it just means bubbles <@171861037438599169>  no shanon is bubble
Yeah cool tatts
> Awa (Ê≥°?) means "bubble" in Japanese. <@171861037438599169>  gimme a sec
> Awa (Ê≥°?) means "bubble" in Japanese. <@171861037438599169>  her fruit name is written in katakana. Awa means bubble or foam and shabon means soap bubble hence shabondy archipelago
I know I mean there two words for bubble chill bro
Oden didn‚Äôt fight kaido at the boiling because he knew it was futile and he had to wait 20 years for the prophecy. I think
Yeah kaido flashback hype
Couldn‚Äôt it just be that kaido wants to keep wano as his territory and oden threatened that so he executed him
I don‚Äôt remember kaido directly asking oden for info
Did we see that !
They paraphrase a lot tho
Bad grammar kills the mood for me
They were the best
Plot holes can still exist in op I mean look at haki pre ts
Why didn‚Äôt the 2nd commander of whitebeard know haki
Why didn‚Äôt he use it against bb
I doubt that oden told the scabbards anything about Raftel
> What's the point of using against BB? <@626378388264976385>  so he wouldn‚Äôt get beat up
If ace knew haki why did he lose to bb
Yeah but he gets more damage still so haki could‚Äôve helped
He just declared war dude
He‚Äôs a bit more reasonable
> ace might as well have been using haki vs bb , we just have no way of knowing <@690158729685106749>  I‚Äôm not looking for a debate but I‚Äôm not convinced by this plot line
Yamato reminds of old luffy big time
Bb is a monster yes. I want to learn more about him
Is it really that kaido has tough skin or does it have to do with king haki. Why is bm so indestructible then
We can‚Äôt get a backstory for every single one tho
I‚Äôm good with denjiro
Yeah it sucks
> this shit fucking sucks, take me back to naruto <@171861037438599169>  black zetsu flashback
I want op lightnovels to have movies
Everything goes back to ryuou in wano lol
Devil fruit mechanics help with power that‚Äôs why he lost to law
Op going sinen this arc
He gets a lot of screen time in the anime
When wb was stabbed by squardo why didn‚Äôt he have a scare in his back
<@!415999229564157955> I‚Äôm really in love with your kiku pic damn
He was a chad
Jack fought for 5 days with no sleep. Dude is underrated
Sulong neko and inu will be goood
Yamato us oden dah
Kin giving luffy some mad respect
Will shinoubu do anything
Zoro had his arc against big dick
Oh yeah wicked lol
> <@!698761447835959337> Oh u saying u don't remember Nami pretending to be ill and then stealing the boat and treasure from the three Buggy pirates that Zoro fought later, leaving them with a storm that made them shipwreck? LOL POSER <@!415999229564157955>  I don‚Äôt tbh
Yamato is just so lovable tho
Some ppl still think ace is Yamato‚Äôs brother and not that ace
Yamato‚Äôs personality is good enough for her to join imo
What about ulti is better than Yamato
What does ussop add then
You‚Äôre either a troll or a weirdo dude
It‚Äôs still too early to have the Yamato for nakama debate
> u did nopt tell me what Yamato brings because she brings nothing as of right now <@550837342517067786>  what did brook bring ?
> <@!564773067969265674> Brook had a direct to Laboon who the crew be friended on the way <@550837342517067786>  yeah but the crew doesn‚Äôt need him. That‚Äôs brook‚Äôs thing which doesn‚Äôt help luffy
Luffy wanted the zombies at thriller bark to join so
It‚Äôs luffy‚Äôs crew he does what he wants
I don‚Äôt even know why were having this debate. Yamato was just introduced and luffy can add whoever he wants
> <@!564773067969265674> Luffy said he wanted a musician and found one in Brook checkmate <@550837342517067786>  first it‚Äôs not a war dude. Second he wanted him to join when he first saw him because he thought brook was cool
> luffy had also been talking about recruiting a musician from the beginning <@95608189361336320>  but he didn‚Äôt know brook was one when he asked him to join right ?
> <@!564773067969265674> u join the brigade to attack me AND u jkust answered ur own question <@550837342517067786>  I‚Äôm not attacking you lol. How did I answer myself ?
> <@!564773067969265674> luffy invites anyone he finds amusing or cool, he loves strange things like an alive skeleton <@375397668727291911>  yeah he invited the zombies in thriller bark too but the crew stopped him so he doesn‚Äôt need a reason to recruit anyone
Can we stop this debate please it‚Äôs going nowhere
> Oh, sorry. This is my first time paying a visit to this server, so I am just following the flow. <@!711869066142416936>  relax bro discord is a shithole
Anything goes here
Op memes are sub par generally
Most memes are about how long one piece is
Yeah buggy d clown memes
They way ussop says condoriano is funny tho
Did sanji learn okama recipes btw
All VAs in op are great
A furry I see
It‚Äôs hella repetitive but funny sometimes
R/futanari is where it‚Äôs at
The message is nice but it‚Äôs kinda cringe  ngl
Oh god no
> Are one piece memes still a thing, though? I thought it was just a phase I used to have in middle school. <@!711869066142416936>  I still try to use haki to this day
Orochi is such a shithead but I still like him tho
I feel like no one respects the wg anyway
The low res and manga style combination is too much dude
They ded
Proud About what
It‚Äôs okay to be retarded
Jk
Btw
You‚Äôre welcome
I like kin but he‚Äôs not nakama material imo
I appreciate his respect for luffy tho
He will probably care for momo
Like a consultant or such
But kin seems to be really close with him
Yeah I can‚Äôt see a reason for him to join
I like how he loves sanji‚Äôs food tho
Yeah but stuff like pizza since they haven‚Äôt had it before is funny
Cmon not this agian
I really like amande‚Äôs design
Yamato is so lively she would be amazing
Bm has too many kids for me to care
If bm joins I‚Äôll be outta here
Who
Oh butter girl
Yeah I‚Äôm all for it
Yeah she got ngl
I really don‚Äôt like boa
Boa is not that hot bro
Chopper believing them was really funny
Will wano be as good as marineford
Alabasta is overhyped imo
Can‚Äôt I have an opinion
You‚Äôre mean dude
It‚Äôs my opinion of people‚Äôs opinion
Why would anyone want to be a marine
> ...save people <@690158729685106749>  yeah from the wg
One day
That‚Äôs even worse phrasing
> different standards <@690158729685106749>  thank you
I want to see more Bonney and Kidd they‚Äôre real pirates
> a backstory need not make you sympathise with a character , i didn't sympathise with big mom <@690158729685106749>  who hurt you
Nvm
Akainu should‚Äôve died wb fucked him up for real
He‚Äôs dedicated
What‚Äôs the difference
> Just annihilated some book worms <@550837342517067786>  please don‚Äôt start another debate let us chill bro. You‚Äôre a troll we get it
Akainu is just doing his job and damn he‚Äôs good at it
> he really has a one dimensional mindset . <@690158729685106749>  that‚Äôs what gives him character
Do the gorosei hold power actually?
> <@!564773067969265674> you are caught up on the reverie, yes? <@242843145501540363>  I know but can they do stuff or is it all imu
All marines are tools
I don‚Äôt think fleet admirals are full out puppets. They just choose the lesser evil
> Man c'mon how can people say he is a nice man I don't hate marines like smoker, aokiji, colby , tashigi etc but no matter what I cannot call killing people justice . And do you guys remember when colby talked to him he would have literally killed him if it wasn't for shanks <@741136344448761887>  well would you consider killing kaido justice
Villains are bad but they‚Äôre like spices. They make things interesting
> Not every Pirate gets executed, if that was the case they won't be needing Impel Down <@292376480426754048>  well impel down is worse because they‚Äôre tortured before executions
> <@564773067969265674> doesn't matter they still live through that <@292376480426754048>  what ? It‚Äôs basically a slow execution
Yeah but how many are there that could survive
Why doesn‚Äôt the wg kill doffy already
> someone please @ him on twitter that he needs to keep his expectations low reading post time skip one piece. > that ' no no no *this* arc is my favorite ' trend will be no more <@690158729685106749>  all of post ts is build up for wano that‚Äôs why it feels slow
How is all of pre ts build up for marineford
Yeah but mentioning bb isn‚Äôt build up
> it has all the major characters with take part in the war , and marinford is the climax to the whole ' morality of pirates vs marines which is good and which is bad ' , of course not every arc is *only* building up to that climax , same as post time skip\ <@690158729685106749>  well post ts only fishman isn‚Äôt build up but everything after is
> <@564773067969265674> explain how <@!198930928083402753>  I meant drum not Jaya
Explain please
Post ts law‚Äôs plan to take down kaido started at punk hazard then dressrosa was part of the plan. Zou brought the minks and raizo wci gave bm reason to go to wano so it‚Äôs all build up
Yes what
> You also have all these charchters that appear here and there every arc that we end up seeing in marineford , doflamingo , mihawk,  whitebeard , ace , kizaru , kuzan , sakazuki, etc , that's build up for MF <@!198930928083402753>  okay but just because we see a character it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs build up for the arc. It‚Äôs world building that helps tho. Marineford build up started with shanondy and you can say Jaya too because bb is introduced but skypia and thriller bark had nothing to do with marineford. Unlike post ts where everything is required for wano to work except fishman island if you don‚Äôt count jinbe and his story
Yeah law could‚Äôve taken Hawkins‚Äô heart back when he went to free bepo
> <@564773067969265674> thriller bark is the arc luffy notices ace vivre card WDYM? Not build up? <@!198930928083402753>  I‚Äôm not tryna argue here. I respect your opinion but it‚Äôs just how I see it
The problem is the difference in the definition of build up. That‚Äôs what I meant by opinion
Chill plz
Well it‚Äôs a discussion not a debate. You don‚Äôt need to change others‚Äô views rather see a different opinion
Do we know why bm and kaido are invulnerable
Well you can‚Äôt damage them mostly
Thick skin thing isn‚Äôt convincing
I heard theories about coc or high level armament
Fun fact : if a person has 40 pounds of fat in their belly then a bullet won‚Äôt get through so big mom is fat has some ground
Well we don‚Äôt know much about coc
I really hope that kaido doesn‚Äôt lose because of oden ptsd
Just like bm hunger
I hope so
Cheap wine is where it‚Äôs at
I‚Äôve seen people say that odens ryuou was trapped in kaido‚Äôs scar that‚Äôs why we see haki clash electricity since kaido didn‚Äôt use armament. What do y‚Äôall think
I love how quickly  topics switch here
Makes sense if she does
What‚Äôs the deal with asura tho is it real or a mirage
It was prolly pirates stopped by him in the gl who were happy
Yeah pirate image doesn‚Äôt help
But little did they know bb came to power
Footage of bb mastering the gura gura
Yeah really where is sanji at
No they‚Äôre just going to get shanks
Recent animation is fire
I just want op to reach 30th anniversary
I think he just feels it
That‚Äôs still and because mental trauma and stuff
Nothing will happen on 1000
Why would anything happen ?
Didn‚Äôt the admirals just use ryuou
What the admirals did us just like raighlay with the elephant
> Raighlay <@!283276421470748673>  whatever dude
How long have we been in wano so far
Damn almost two years
Two weeks till next chapter
WSJ break but three chapters afterwards
Two years almost
Yeah I was shocked to know too
I thought it was less than a year
Peros us gonna fight bm or kaido or both
> Dressrosa was 1 day <@!199878649426477056>  that‚Äôs why I love it
> We dont know if he joins Luffys side <@!283276421470748673>  he won‚Äôt join luffy he wants to be captain
He has lit 1 named attack dude
Can you feed a dead body a devil fruit <:TamaThink:740778292159709304>
Birdcage too op tho
What was the cage made of anyways
Didn‚Äôt luffy break doffy‚Äôs strings and couldn‚Äôt law have cut the cage with his def
If kin knew advanced armament couldn‚Äôt he have cut it still
There‚Äôs your proof of how powerscaling in op is bs
Yeah plot stuff too
I love how doffy is so chillaxed all the time
> <@564773067969265674> not when talking with law üòè <@!199878649426477056>  law is special to him
> He only had to be outside the birdcage and no one could touch him <@371317614821244929>  big brain time
Ace making hats for oars jr was too sad
Why did they want Moria dead anyway
No one respects Moria
Yeah kaido fucked up moria
If Moria steals kaido‚Äôs shadow and eats it can he beat bm
Let them Rest In Peace bro
> Moria will force Luffy to fight Zombie Ace <@!393767426526806027>  would be cool to see but I doubt it
Luffy would be livid
Yeah but they would be weak
Can zombies eat dfs tho
Yeah but he can‚Äôt get strong shadows
A lot actually
There‚Äôs a sketch somewhere with names
https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Roger_Pirates
Here see a lot
Your taste is shit then
Ok
<@328936254978916352> I was just kidding bro hope it‚Äôs okay
> <@!564773067969265674> <:ShanksWeird:638104331572215821> no bro , i am very offended , apologize 5 times in a row <@328936254978916352>  nah fuck you
Did the mountain bandits have bounties
That fall was weird dude
The impact was huge from that fall. Why tho
Not even tekking know this shit
Why seven legs on each side and not eat tf
Madoka right
Tell us the list bro
Could be worse
They feed if the debates
Is that HxH vacuum girl
Bro imma choke from laughing
Voice acting in op is top tier
Robin screaming I want to live wasn‚Äôt that impactful for me but when she held to the pavement with her teeth a piece of me died
> "Death is not an apology!" <@!114296407816404992>  damn the memories bro
Toki talking to oden before the boiling and knowing he will die yet she still  tells him he won‚Äôt was mega sad
Brook should‚Äôve died from all the trauma before the poiso.
Yeah he knows the value of people and friends
Calling her hound lady lol
Brook is amazing man
He is actually older than bm
After enies lobby she is
Zoro is still afraid of stairs
Chopper‚Äôs flashback was the saddest for me
They all have issues lol
Nah fuck it I wanna be sad
Kaido gives you free booze at least
Zoro flashback doesn‚Äôt count
Robin and chopper backstories are really similar
They were both outcasts
And so was chopper for his nose
And hiluluk loved him
Hiluluk drinking the soup was mega sad
Still waiting for zoro full flashback tho
Is zoro confirmed shimotsuki
Yeah me too
It‚Äôs not bc sanji got one but because we still don‚Äôt know much
Why tho sanji wci flashback was great
> <@!564773067969265674> because he is not like sanji <@509083474955599874>  do you mean the exact same story or a flashback in general
How is it realistic? Only unborn children die from stairs
> you can die from stairs <@509083474955599874>  I fell from the top of high stairs in second grade right on my face and I‚Äôm still here
> Plus, "falling down the stairs" might also mean "suicide", it's an expression in japan iirc <@!415999229564157955>  this was debunked, I think
How tf do you die from stairs <:WBeardWhat:638862189771620372>
> <@!564773067969265674> Anecdotal evidence is not good evidence. Thousands die from falling from stairs. It's how you fall and what may have been damaged. Don't just mock victims by saying only "unborn children" die from stairs. <@!415999229564157955>  if you die from stairs then you deserve it bc you weak
How tf does stairs kill people tho
Ok I give up dude
> he's part of the buggy pirates... that says a lot about him <@573221936809902080>  true
I‚Äôm only 4 years old at heart
> Malicious ignorance, even, saying some people deserve to die <@!415999229564157955>  so hitler didn‚Äôt
Bro this is killing me
I‚Äôm starting to feel that you‚Äôre serious bro
If you‚Äôre serious then I was just joking bro and if you‚Äôre still  joking then you got me good
Yeah sure
Anyways does rubber float
Not all warlords are same strength tho
Look at Moria
She ain‚Äôt that strong if can avoid her fruit
She can only turn people to stone
> <@564773067969265674> only <@606196171307745308>  yeah either mero mero mero or kicking them what else can she do for real
I might have forgotten
> <@!564773067969265674> this is wrong <@!372464153480134666>  please tell me how I‚Äôd love to know
All her attacks turn people to stone tajari what I was saying
So if coby can avoid being affected by her fruit shouldn‚Äôt he be good theoretically
Momonga did it
Yeah so it‚Äôs possible
I‚Äôm not saying he will def defeat her tho
Don‚Äôt get me wrong
Hurting yourself might not be the only way
This is all theoretical that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called speculation
Does haki help against her kids
Yeah so if coby has good enough haki he can hold his own then
I‚Äôm not sure about her haki level tbh
I‚Äôm not tryna say he will def win
Just an idea
Yeah she should have armament
But it‚Äôs a huge stretch to say that he‚Äôll def lose too
Do you really believe that coby is that weak
He might not win but he has a low-fat chance at least
If it comes down to haki I don‚Äôt think coby will be one shotted
Is he not really
If he‚Äôs not confirmed for armament then I stand corrected
If koby sees luffy‚Äôs face in Amazon Lilly he might have a change of heart lol
> <@!564773067969265674> "I can't win this fight. I'm sorry.. Garp-san" <@!415999229564157955>  garp will surely understand
Is Yamato taller than brook tho
Yamato seems like she would show him
Why would they want to capture the warlords tho ? They have the worst gen running around and most warlords keep to them selves
It might be to show the power of the ssg
DBF was fun as a one off thing but using it seriously would be lame imo
Did we learn doffy‚Äôs bounty when he was captured or nah
> 340 million was Doffys bounty <@!283276421470748673>  really ? Seems low
Doffy is a huge threat 340 is too low for the info he holds
Did they freeze doffy‚Äôs bounty before he blackmailed them
> <@564773067969265674> No one knew he was Joker, dude <@!274366418223497217>  but they shoulda still known about his status
If human fruit is zoan plants should be too. I think
Yeah but in the op context it should be zoan since they‚Äôre living creatures
Logia or paramicia won‚Äôt make sense
But Hawkins doesn‚Äôt turn to straw
It‚Äôs ryuu
Didn‚Äôt it use to be each arc
But then arcs got long
It would be crazy if kin betrayed the group
Isn‚Äôt hajrudin the giant from dressrosa
Buggy was born with clown nose lol
His make up was green at some point but it isn‚Äôt now right ?
Bots have feelings you know
What happened to captains John treasure ? Did buggy find it
It has to be weird every once in a while
Ace is only cool in fan arts
That‚Äôs too much even for me
Damn that‚Äôs cool
Alvida is Yamato they use the same weapon boom
Pink or purple is best I‚Äôve seen
That‚Äôs creepy
Jeez
Yamato has aesthetic
That‚Äôs cool
Wouldn‚Äôt say master
Kaido called it ryuou last chapter so it‚Äôs kinda weird
Kaido is fodder dude
No please
> i feel like ryuu is just easier for non japanese speakers because ryu is like a common word u see in games and anime, and ryuuou just looks weird in english but thats what it is <@!145742024803352576>  ryuu means dragon and in Japanese the wano haki is called ryuou but it‚Äôs better to use whatts easier
Seems like it
> <@!564773067969265674> i mean we all know what  we talking about when we say ryuu haki <@!145742024803352576>  yeah exactly but people hang onto stuff
Black Maria might avoid conflict
Damn boy
Oof
It will probably be orochi color
Viz makes all laughs the same
It‚Äôs really dumb
Bro I‚Äôve legit been here for 10 hours
I need to get a life
Yeah 14 hours my ass
Bro some VAs died and op is till going
Zoro‚Äôs va is awesome
> I mean who died <@581522752712867850>  roger and I think kizaru too
Others died too
Black bread‚Äôs va is cool too
Iconic
Otsuru and denjiro designs are great
Same
I like the name kyoshiro better
It was a wig all along tho
Server is dead nice
Yeah that‚Äôs me lol
Btw when you write my name it feels creepy
Idk why lol
It‚Äôs genuinely creepy dude
I don‚Äôt think so
When it‚Äôs a tag it‚Äôs fine but when someone makes the effort to write it it feels weird
Why did I tell you guys oh god
That opening sucked
Old openings and last few are the best imo
The ones in between were mid
> Bon Voyage so nice <@!145742024803352576>  someone gets it
Yeah hope is dope
That was good too
I miss old one piece
Good night bro
Op is all filler bro
Such bs
Nah it‚Äôs just the weird part of the server
Is katakuri‚Äôs mochi edible
Getting too weird
I don‚Äôt find anyone boring tbh
Cmon robin hating franky in choppers body isn‚Äôt boring
Females in wano have been great so far
Not hiyori tho
I still don‚Äôt trust hiyori
> yeh , robin has those moments once in a while , but overall i find her personality very bland ,not helped by the lack of focus oda puts on her<@!564773067969265674> <@328936254978916352>  true she doesn‚Äôt get much screen time
Can we get a good topic please
Art is great lately too
I want worst gen to make moves
> discord is so buggy for me I‚Äôm like minutes behind my bad if I‚Äôm late on topics <@!521427565492305931>  it doesn‚Äôt matter dude there ain‚Äôt no topics anymore
I wanna see more Bonney and Kidd
Yeah she was at reverie
I stopped caring about shanks tbh
We don‚Äôt see enough for me to care
Shanks is only theories
> mihawk is one cm shorter than shanks <@328936254978916352>  shanks > mihawk confirmed by canon evidence
Zeph is your nami pic from a spread
That was a good spread
One punch is the shit
Especially the webcomic
> <@!564773067969265674> <@!145742024803352576>  not cool bro
> neither for opm or mob <@301180109275136000>  I don‚Äôt think mob has a webcomic
Hyo flexing next episode
Yeah weirdos do
Why does he need to coat his face for haki spit tho
You one of those who write colour instead of color www
Trashkey
Boa only slave that matters
> do you think kaku has a square dick <@217616268088442882>  you mean cube
Big brain
> Usopps nose is probably bigger than-let‚Äôs change topics <@!521427565492305931>  please continue
Smiles are dumb btw
You guys have lives
> I don‚Äôt want to say anything bad about kishinoto bc I don‚Äôt want to start !os but just know I find that statement abhorrent <@!521427565492305931>  I even forgot the story dude. Shits wack
Togashi has nice art tho
Nah that‚Äôs too good
<:OrochiLaugh:632823459541680138>
Tama is so cute
It‚Äôs been a nice journey so it doesn‚Äôt matter what the op is tbh
Night
Doppio is that you
You win nothing
That‚Äôs actually a pretty good joke
Just say it it‚Äôs better than silence
True
There‚Äôs art of everything
Best art
Bc mods are lame
He says it would be dangerous here or smth
Archer reference hell yeah
Can‚Äôt wait for Kaido backstory
Does my doujin count as fan art
What do you guys think happened to toki. Is she dead
Love it
Novels are Canon tho right
> so how do you explain the similarities between tama and yamato ? <@328936254978916352>  shitty female design
I mean faces and such
Yamato looks great but I still mistake her face for nami
It‚Äôs just my experience
Otherwise I stab Yamato
Is it bad that I laughed
What‚Äôs the time elapsed in the story so far
Did oda confirm or is it just estimates
> <@!564773067969265674> Oda confirmed the measurements in SBS. We have pre ts and post. MF is crazy <@!415999229564157955>  bro I meant the time not measurements. Chillax
You seem to be really into measurements
Who else
Violet in the anime was the worst
She was inhumane even by op standards

Tf is this
That‚Äôs legit funny
Ussop‚Äôs face tho
Fun fact ; age of consent in Japan used to be 14
Maybe still us
Japan is weird
Sanji especially can‚Äôt forget her
Zoro > sanji
Oof
> Also bc she is 1/4 mermaid <@!415999229564157955>  that‚Äôs not how genetics work. I think
> <@!564773067969265674> Oda said she is 1/4 mermaid, nothing I can do about that <@!415999229564157955>  oh sorry carry on
Still confused about trebol
Is he even human
Lao G was the best tho
Strong world pushed nami hard
Both
The good days
Tb was fun
Brook backstory too
Big brain
Chopper man and luffy oyabun were amazing
It‚Äôs getting too weird guys
Shanks helped Moria move tb with his space time fruit
Moria got thrown around by everyone all his career
Which one had the day shift in zou
Did they make amends
Damn I need to reread zou
Bepo sulong hype
Is Moria human
What kind of human is that
Why does Moria look like a bowling pin tho
And they fell to his thighs
True
I‚Äôm just too insecure
Don‚Äôt remind me of my pain bro
Who cares about Moria
Why
Weird but ok
I agree but I don‚Äôt wanna see him anymore
True
He was interesting but not for long
I might need to reread to check him out agian
You got some good points tho
I stand somewhat corrected
I love the arc but Moria not so much
Manga is always better unless there‚Äôs music involved
His voice was fitting tho
TB is underrated
Which is perfect for his personal
We need more straw hat interactions
Absolom was cool but mega creep
Lit predator
Doffy is way better than Moria
But Moria has his place in the world
Imagine Moria eating bb shadow
I doubt he could do it
We‚Äôre Moria and kaido equal ??
Man topics sure change quickly here
Ulti using a mace is hella cool
Kaido‚Äôs fodder really be dumb
Who
Not helping bro
Tf is that
Lit never seen him before
How many names characters are there
Wow that‚Äôs a lot
Last I heard was 800
How did buggy swallow that thing
I‚Äôm choking from here
Luffy wining that fight was bs fight me
Yeah
Still don‚Äôt him but keep trying
How would that work
I have to know
> He probably went insidw and m*sterbated there <@450928710661701633>  reminds me of a shirahoshi doujin
Jeez chill guys
Yeah please
Nothing
Marines will take advantage for sure
That‚Äôs why drake is there
Calm down king
She‚Äôs too op already
A df would be a nerf
Imagine a penguin df
Oof
Yet a sloth smile
> have you all ever thought ab how much time we waste on here <@738998014039031888>  do you have anything better to do
Thai fandom really loves scopper gaban and the egg
Is big news awakened
Damage
Did robin actually find info in the alabasta poneglyph
About aw
Was it pluton
Damn luffy has a good crew
Franky probably read the plans too
But he‚Äôs valuable now
Wg should increase robin and franky bounty
What do you wanna with it
Who‚Äôs the shadow following jinbe and robin tho
I wanna see kuzan
I have feeling robin and jinbe will be captured
Bb won‚Äôt show up marines might tho
