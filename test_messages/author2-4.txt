Imagine Nami
She loves baths too much, also swimming
> no but you cannot see Mochi in nature <@!631190162566676480> humans as much a part of nature as any other animal
<:ShanksYes:727411684095819856>

that makes sense
Remove it from your body
Yo u turn into a pickle, that's the funniest shit I've ever seen
Kinda acidic
I'd meat the human human fruit
idk
Kinda salty, are we?
Adam had an excellent observation in <#164971940648321024>
Possible
And now Moe is trying to make us think this is all a joke
I'm kind of a genius actually
<:CrocoMods:674104771661266944>
you wouldn't understand
I have a PhD in Onepieceology
I'm also a med student on the side tho
I was actually listing my many discoveries in the field, but I chose to be humble
Oh really? Have you heard of the H13V6D7 virus?
No? No need to thank me
That's right
That's also why I only listed one virus
Rookie stuff
0 bc u have nothin
Sure u have if u are saving people from non existent viruses
Kind of a fraud
pls don't let me go
What happens next
show me how
What if your words are actually mine
That's very much possible. Agreeing to the possibility of the situation shows intellectual superiority, or not... or maybe slightly
You just hesitated
oh
So intelligent, that one
some secs
Ok I'll admit I'm not a PhD in Onepieceology
My son has that name
One Piece will finally be known and stop being a rookie manga
as old as I am
oh no
I'm kinda one of those fats
Without the joined part
Wow fats doesn't remember me, pfft I thought we had a thing
In 2007 I was not doing intellectual things like watching One Piece. So much potential lost
> Hey <@!415999229564157955> I hope I didn’t go too far with the big brain jokes. It’s all in good fun buddy <@!564773067969265674> This is a sign of defeat <:FranKEKer:635609882438926376>
Nah it's all fine. I love those big brain takes
I was gonna buy the OP manga in japanese, might as well later. I think I'll just buy english for now
now meaning next years when I stop feeling like a pirate
I'll build a Thousand Sunny, fate. Join me
> Volumes are like 5 $ stoopid <@!564773067969265674> I only have money to eat and survive
5 dollars is like a lot of rice
Rice and pasta
Where I live at least
pasta, those spaghetti things
Those mac stuffs
But fr if I'd buy volumes those big boxes are the best option for fresh new
> Am I the only one who likes plain pasta <@!564773067969265674> I love it, just salt and water. Maybe some marguerine
Sensory pleasure is opened by meditation Ohmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Pasta, salt and maybe some oil and I'm good
No need for those secretions in my pasta
> <@!415999229564157955>  exactly, and then I drink the water with all the pasta and sauce essence <@!564773067969265674> Yes, a classic
If I'm feeling lucky, I soak the bread in the sauce
Peanut butter or no peanut butter with bananas?
Real questions
Right answer
Oh man
The good thing with pleasure from eating is that you can find it in a lot of places, Zyphyris
Depends who I'm trying to impress
If a country girl, on the fries. If some bourgeoisie girl, on the side
> The answer is Mayo <@!564773067969265674> My home-made mayo is real cool
> what if its a boy? <@!95648410492731392> Normally boys don't need the fries with me <:NamiFlush:625741106193367054>
Boys are more straight-forward
> Do you make pickles at home  too stoopid <@!564773067969265674> No, but would love to
Trying is part of the process
If u like it, u continue
Drink cow tit secretion <:WBDisgust:650047749831524372>
Imagine eating bee ass secretions
Bee vomit yeah, all the same
pbj I can accept
!disgusting
> What other animal secretion do humans eat <@!564773067969265674> So milk, honey, eggs...
Do humans eat that?
Interesting. I guess if the web is just there...
uh
Hmmm scorpion corpse popsicle
Well people in this side eat pigs and rabbits and chickens and bee vomit
LOL





Kiku is humble, she cares for her friends deeply, she has a badass side and is an all out samurai bro
plus she cute
Both her masks are crazy cool
I'd like to see more of Sanji's recipes
He is in the beginning of a war and doesn't cook a make you go berserk and kill everyone meal? Hack
99
Well he has cooked
The cake and the meal after PH
Plus the soba
He used that in PH
No, two
The cream in the cake is one too
The Punk Hazard one was after the battle and it isn't filler, it's the Hormone Soup with Sea Pork. The cream in the cake is also not filler.
OHHHHH
> It just is a really cool concept especially when fighting a yonko crew to give them some sort of edge over them <@!521783526878609418> Yeah and the two we see have cool properties, the first rejuvenates you after a battle to regain your strength; the second is so sweet that people eating it can almost die
That's a cool ass bot
<@!521427565492305931>
> But the cake thing is literally just cake filling <@!521783526878609418> Nah, it's the absolute sweetness, it can take people out. Look at Bege
> Sanji dumping 46 bags of pure cane sugar is not a "secret recipe" <@!178106988687917056> Not what he did. There was a whole recipe. Just adding sugar doesn't help
> Yeah the cake thing kinda dumb tbh <@!521783526878609418> pls explain, when even Bege was almost taken out
The Newkama recipes are meant to be 99 all with different properties
> Something being so sweet to take someone out isn't a cool recipe that can physically enhance the crew to change the way a fight goes <@!521783526878609418> It can decrease enemy forces
> And if that didn't exist the arc wouldn't have gone any different at all Not the point
I'm talking about the recipe itself, not how Sanji used it
Oda could've made him work with more of the recipes for sure, but I hope many are like the cream, with interesting properties like that
> A MAN'S DREAM WILL NEVER END!! <@!734026065508433922> wrong
Sanji is as serious as he is goofy
Mr. Prince, in Wano when getting Toko, when he agrees with Zoro in leaving Usopp behind
Yeah that one was fucked up
!oda2
Yeah it's a cool part of him to me. But this one with BM was too much

Arlong is cute. Yes?🔳  No?🔳
> But going back to my question earlier, Will you guys like it if big mom became a friendly to luffy <@!547300083658522624> bm is kind of a monster, she has kidnapped and forced too many men to be her husbands, she takes lives like it's nothing. She is in Caesar levels of disgust. Unless she has a spiritual change and becomes a buddhist monk, I can't see her being friendly to anyone other than talking food
but this is general -cries-
> why can't i send pictures nooo <@!165987509858336769> You can. You just don't know how muahahahhahahahahahhaha <#522036834310815744>

> How did coby grew from being a kid to a teenager in 2 years <@!547300083658522624> In less than that, in some months. He was a teen post Ennies Lobby
BM should die
> She ATE her mom <@!734026065508433922> accident
> Big mom isn't that evil to need to die <@!346692838328893452> She kidnapped and forced her husbands to have children with her (sbs volume 90), she takes the lives of people who wanna leave...
Kidnapping several husbands and having children with them is not ignoring everything else
BM is evil, no way to deny it
Her child self could be sweet, sure, but she now does a lot of evil stuff deliberately as an adult
She kidnaps dozens of husbands and forces a pregnancy bro
Not enough to die, sure. But evil, extremely evil
> I'm just saying out of all the evil characters we've seen Big mom isn't even in top 5. <@!346692838328893452> She easily is. Tell who those 5 are
Caesar, Doffy, Kaido?
Evil - one who creates unnecessary suffering to others, being it only necessary if it means one's survival or health.
What does Holdem do?
Believe?
U mean Hody?
Holdem is quite nice in compariso
Who is creating the most suffering directly?
> "Yes I committed genocide, but it was *for a reason*" <@!171861037438599169> That's way more dangerous than the comically evil. I don't know which is more evil, but the one who can grow to power easier is the one who can invent reasons for the evil and is not seen as doing evil just because
Who is hurting more people is an easier question
Kaido creates more suffering, so he is more evil. That's an utilitarian way to see it
If the suffering is unnecessary to the one creating the suffering, what's the difference?
I agree, fats
The only thing one could think to make me justify the suffering is "I needed this to survive or maintain my health". Anything else is about actions and suffering created unnecessarily
If you do it crying or smiling makes no difference to your necessity of such suffering, nor does it make a difference to the victim
Appeals to nature are not moral justifications, they are fallacious arguments
> BM killed her mother, Doffy killed his father. Same action but is the evil the same? Intent matters just as much as actions. <@!521427565492305931> One is deliberated, the other isn't. Two deliberate actions make no difference, though. If you kill someone knowingly bc u hate them (Doffy), or because they aren't working well (CDs to slaves), then their intentions don't matter. It only matters that the action was deliberated, it was a decision. Big Mom had no decision on it, she wasn't a moral agent
Sure, I believe deliberately killing someone without need to (needs as in survival), then it is a morally evil action
> "Religion is the opium of the people"  - Mona Lisa (source: believe me bro)
> they pay with soul as tax but they get protection from the rest of the new world <@!228271420445163521> Only if they have the decision to just leave. Do they?
option*
If they can't leave Tottoland, then it's not making them a favor
If they can't leave, then it is wrong, because it is removing the decision from them

> like, can he slice kaido <@!547300083658522624> There's the haki situation. If Kaido's haki is strong enough, what will Oda cut?
> He was able to slice someone full clad in Haki (vergo) so I’d assume so <@!478681268532281347> bc his haki was stronger. Vergo was being dumb for using haki in all the body
Now that we know armament is something that flows and that advanced techniques are about making it flow to one spot, putting it in the whole body is dumb
I don't think haki would have anything to do. Foxy should be able to slow Kaido
But not forever so
<:CroShockoKid:680940244157333594>
> if foxy just uses the beam every 30 seconds, why can he not permanently slow down kaido? <@!171861037438599169> The time he'd use to reactivate the technique would be enough to Kaido fuck him up. Or if that's a stretch, imagine no one is there to deal damage to Kaido, how will Foxy get out of that situation?
> are you saying it takes more than 30 seconds to reactivate? <@!171861037438599169> No, that either Kaido uses the milisecs there, or that Foxy would have nowhere to run

Mihawk will start the Mihawk Pirates after saving Perona and Moria from BB
Nah the Mihawk Pirates seem cooler, there's the whole aesthetic
> defeating mihawk is the only way <@!328936254978916352> Mihawk dies. There's a new swordsman in town. Boom, not the only way
> yeh , i said afterwards , ' unless mihawk dies ' <@!328936254978916352> Mihawk becomes a weak old man. BOOM not only unless he dies
> most likely both zoro and mihawk will live Yeah their story has been pretty much set in stone, I think
But someone somehow removing his objective from the equation could also be interesting
> yeah , but you would still need to defeat mihawk Nah, if someone uses the "brain damage no mi", there'd be no Mihawk  to fight
> Interesting but infuriating yes, I don't see how Oda would make that work
He'd be already fucked up, there would be no value in killing him
Swordsman Grand Competition, à la bad manga
Hmmm I don't see that happening. Luffy will just meet the Mihawk Pirates on the way
Then Mihawk will create the Mihawk Pirates, not join BB. BB are soooo out of the dracula aesthetic
> Halloween pirates with Mihawk, Moria, Perona, Hogback and Absalombie <@!283276421470748673> This is the only thing that makes sense
Yeah but what about the Mihawk Pirates, Vegito?
4 admirals at least

You're so wrong, fats. My headcanon has tribal cry haka type of crazy Red Hair Pirates when meeting enemies at sea. What does yours have? Pff
Nothing is the answer, btw
Izo and Kiku just have those good genetics
That just means your headcanon is at the level of Oda's, fats. Mine is above that

I'm not that sniperwolf person btw
> Coz that’s not true <@!474659436804177930> prove it
yes
Oh, I thought you had a reason to say that with so much certainty, like a grammar issue in the translation. But if it is "they couldn't use observation back then", then it really has little to no value
That is the point, you said that moment possibly implying BB being multiple people was "not true"
We can say that it isn't likely for those reasons, and that it was probably said to mention BB's crew and not himself, now dismissing the possibility due to some inexistence of evidence of them having the power to sense it is not valid
I'm not saying anything, I'm not even claiming anything. I'm saying lack of evidence is not enough to dismiss a possibility completely
The stretch is dismissing it as a possible interpretation because the other interpretation makes more sense. Yeah, the latter makes more sense, we can all agree I think, but saying the former is "not true" is claiming to know more than what we know
> That’s such a redundant thing to say. Obvious things without official confirmation can’t be claimed as wrong hurdur <@!474659436804177930> That's simple things in life bro. You can dismiss it as relevant, but you can't say it is "not true"
Then you're talking about your interpretation of it and not about factual claims, so idc
still your interpretation, so that's fine
> This is what annoys me. Bring something that can make the idea of “it was referring to the crew” not sound like the only possibility. In stead of just saying “ItS yOuR iNtErPrEtAtIoN” but technically not a fact. Coz I hate when the discussion can’t progress <@!474659436804177930> But that's what happens when we lack information. Your interpretation can be whatever and we can talk about it, explore it. However, we can do that without dismissing other possibilities as false. I also think it was about the crew, but if it is about the crew, then there's nothing left to say, is there?
I'm not saying he doesn't, it's a normal conversation
Doom is talking about the burden of proof. Sure, if you have evidence to falsify a hypothesis you can show it, but it is the burden of the one making the claim to show evidence for the claim. Claims without evidence can be dismissed without evidence
You have to define theory in this context
If it is anime type of theory, sure
But now we are talking about what makes theories solid and likely, and not about claims themselves
My BB theory is he doesn't sleep bc he's scared Ace might come to get him. Fucking loser
Marco
Polo
Orochi is known in the underworld as the fruit collector, for he has 8 fruits
Doom, don't attack me like that
Yeah, it's not a solid theory at all
Arabasta is not a place for smartasses
Well I only talked about you claiming it was wrong, I never said I didn't agree the theory is dumb
If it was, then that's it
> But do the same for others plz <@!474659436804177930> Who said the theory was "not true"?
He called it stupid, he didn't claim it was not a possibility in the first place
But it’s not interesting in the sense that Zoro said “they” which could imply they knew he was multiple people or whatever Coz that’s not true
You can see how another interpretation was you claiming it could not imply, which is explicitly what I was talking about. If you corrected me before and explained you meant it isn't interesting, then the conversation would've ended before
LOL that's just how I write, I guess.
U were the one saying we should do the same for Doom and Choc, I was explaining why I didn't
That's it. It's done
<:Uso:637751966184767546>

BM was a dumbass, I mean
Sorry for being ambiguous
> Not actual strength <@!522829790076600364> you can see his arm getting pumped on the right
reread
U need to reread the panels bro
> clearly she just pumped their motivation to lift some weights, so offscreen that dude went and did 1000 bench presses before coming back <@!319767910098796544> Oh yes, of course
It shows a person getting his muscles all pumped lol
It's mental and physical
It's the perfect fruit for a revolutionairy
never claimed u were the only one
I came in in the middle of the convo
> <@!415999229564157955> tbh it doesn’t change the fact that she needs allys to use it on, can't see how it'd help herself if somebody attacks her <@!704581670921306153> She can be strong without devil fruit powers, look at Zoro, Sanji, Rayleigh, etc etc. The powers themselves are perfect to create revolution
coomie in the chat
Tell us other fruits good for revolution. The propaganda propaganda no mi? Nah, Belo Betty's is da best
> if anything, her devil fruit is a bit too convenient lmao <@!474659436804177930> Maybe it was due to her fruit that she decided she needed to use the power. Cause and effect ooohoohoo
It's Streusen being a chef with that fruit
Facxts
Lindbergh may be the only named mink, but he isn't the only named Revo furry
You wouldn't understand, Frost
Shanks being the most difficult to find was in the novel, wasn't it? Is that info canon tho?
in the manga* for the novel is canon types
!chapterwait
Luffy will enter Kaido's mouth
What if Luffy enters Kaido and then goes Gear 3?
Robin is Luffy's stepmom
She is old enough to be his stepmom so

"GANBARE MUGIWARA BOY"
He was the one fixing the door in Romance Dawn, but he wasn't seen

Wow

WTF

Funny meme haha made laugh
> they took that one sbs wayyy too seeriously man <@!393700846707146754> It's canon tho
Nami only fans
Arturcanon
Shichibukai > no organization
LOL CHOPPER
> why do they use the same picture twice So that you can see it two times, u might forget after one time
WRONG

oops

looooooooooool
One Piece speedread for the maximum appreciation of the story
> <@!153273023456083969> no it implies that some of us understand liteature, while most casually look at pictures and surface meanings only <@!543991021793574922> You're not smart, bro
I've seen better trolls
ryuo is haki
Youss speedreads
It doesn't Talon
Reread
Speedreader detected
You can't even spell casuals
Speedreader, go reread that part
Show the panels u speedreader
He'll come back with the panel with Zoro cutting the coast line
WHERE IS THE PANEL
Show the panel dude
If you need to copy paste the wiki and can't show manga panels, u dum dum
Show us the panel
How can't u understand "show us the panel"
Someone so smart not knowing what "show the panel" means
Show the panel
LOL
Pffft "I can't even show a panel to back my dumb claims"
> ryou is special haki <@!699125747939278888> Wrong.
!ryuo
See, panels
Wow, panels, amazing
Smart literature connoisseur can't understand manga panels
> Enma does not enhance your Ryou <@!543991021793574922> No, it takes the haki from the user even if the user doesn't want to and therefore cuts more. The limit is still the user's haki from all we know
> What is Ryuo/haki? <@!543991021793574922> Did you not understand how armament haki flows? Hyogoro explains that
It takes more than needed, it doesn't enhance
LOL dude
You don't even understand basic manga literature
Enma makes the user use more of his haki compared to what the user intended, not compared to what the user previously could use. Reread
> <@!415999229564157955> using more haki=STRONGER HAKI <@!543991021793574922> But the limit is still what Zoro can use. So Zoro does not have more haki with Enma, dum dum
Haki does not last forever. So if a sword is taking more haki than what u want, your haki will drain and you'll get tired faster
Reread
> HE SAID IT HIMSELF <@!543991021793574922> He says that if he comes to a point where he can tame Enma, that means he is stronger
!flowchart
> So yall are really claiming Enma isnt a stronger sword <@!543991021793574922> You said it enhanced haki LOL. Enma is a tough sword to use, so the user needs to be strong, that's it
!oops
> <@!415999229564157955> It enhances Haki by drawing out more.  Haki is litearlly willpower..  having more willpower will always be stronger then using less lol...come on guys <@!543991021793574922> No because if the user can't tame the sword, it will take all of his haki and therefore he will be tired quickly. You know why Luffy's Gear 4 doesn't last forever, right? Reread
He is training with Enma exactly because Enma is tough to tame and takes too much haki, making u tired in battle unnecessarily. If you can tame the sword, it means you are tough enough to counter Enma's properties
LOL
Shitposting phase
Haki doesn't last forever dude
You saw what it did to Zoro's arm, he would be done if he couldn't tame Enma. Using more of your haki than needed is not necessarily an upgrade, it is actually a downgrade if you aren't strong enough to use the sword, that's why Zoro used it to get better
At least these dumb takes create an active chat
LOL
Foreshadowed lol
Show the panel where it is foreshadowed
Therefore?
If it was in the entire post TS, you can show at least some panels
Of the foreshadowing
> I dont have panels laying around <@!543991021793574922> Search for them
Makes claim, can't defend it. All that talk means zero then
Show us
That's not enough

Roger was just a man. How would he be better than Garp?
How is Roger stronger than Garp if Roger is just a man
Stahp this chat
muaaa
> why could wyper make enel tangible with sea stone?Sea stone is supposed to weaken not nulify dfs <@!703504844903940096> It can weaken to the state of not being able to use the powers. Didn't Smoker get traped in seastone cages more than once?
He can stretch if other people pull is body parts, isn't that so?
Well seastone and the ocean have a similar energy, that's why the marines use seastone under their ships when passing through the calm belt, as it confuses the sea kings, but they eventually find out
?
the salt?
!water
even rivers
could be idk
clouds, yes
Usopp couldn't use the cloud dial after Skypiea, but Nami now can using her bling bling weather science
Well I guess
Orlumbus is really clean
Would make a great husband

> anyone else worried about the anime catching up with the manga <@!137620430788755456> They can do their stuff, don't worry
Wano Filler Wano Filler Wano Filler
Yeah
I want to see a Franky battle against fodder when Zoro trusts Franky to cover him after Yasu's death
I like it better with bubbles
> Hopefully we see all the sh shine  <:odapls:704596787180208159>
Big Mom is strong
Franky's fruit
Nami and Chopper did too, maybe not to the same scale
Stop this convo
Dude, go read some books
Stop
Everyone can rape people. Stop this conversation
<#456573949120217089> rule 2
That was the one advertising
I was also trying to stop a stupid convo, but it seems to be done
I'll just be here if someone wants to discuss smth he says
Do u know what Jobo and Bartolomeu have in common?
They were both seen urinating to a body of water publicly
Thanks for coming to daily facts
Hope so
Some characters that should have names don't too so it's a double edged sword
!chapterwait
Brook has the right answer tho
It's not two in a row tho
Wait is it?
986 to 987 wereq week apart
> I am not enjoying my time waiting <@!383464767421153290> Don't ever even try to speak to Lord Brook, who had to wait for decades, ever again
I don't want 3 chapters in a row. There, I said it
> <@!415999229564157955> Brook did not need to wait for the next One Piece chapter, though, just for human interaction and salvation and sunlight. Clearly we have it worse. <@!383464767421153290> And his best friend Laboon
3 chapters in a row means One Piece will be closer to ending
I don't want it to end
Also sooner two piece ends tho
sooner it ends
<:PepegaLuffy:595458349248675847>
Don't create dumb expectations and enjoy the ride
