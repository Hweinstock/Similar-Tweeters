Zunesha and the Sea Kings are friends and just talk it out
The thing is, if there are many sea kings like those in calm belt, why did Oda reuse some in FMI
Yamato is not superficial. Deep down she has organs too, she ain't just skin and hair
Prove me Yamato doesn't have lungs
I just think it's better to assume she has internal organs than say Yamato is superficial
> Can robin grow limbs inside of people <@!564773067969265674> If she can make a clone of herself, can she just sprout blood everywhere?
> <@!415999229564157955>  can she grow a mouth inside of kaido and bite his heart ? <@!564773067969265674> Doesn't she have to see it tho (iirc)? If that's the case she'd have to create eyes inside his mouth and esophagus and then the mouth where the heart is. I believe in her
> <@!415999229564157955>  I don’t think that she can see his heart form his throat but good point <@!564773067969265674> She can't, but heart (specifically the left atrium) is directly in front of his esophagus (which goes to your stomach, it doesn't stay in the throat), so she'll see where it beats and just bite that part. She'll get the heart for sure, as it is really close. The esophagus is so close to the heart that the left atrium has an esophageal impression. Of course Oda knows this
Oda needs to know
Carrot hate? No it has pre-Carrot love. They are still ignorant
> But the fact that she just us alive and hasn't done anything heart moving or anything is pretty obvious that shes a side character <@!521783526878609418> Nothing? Reread
Nah you made a claim she did nothing heart moving and that it made it obvious she was a side character. Those are claims about the story, not just opinions
Saying "what she did didn't impress me" is an opinion. Saying she didn't do anything that makes her more than a side character is a claim to be discussed, not an opinion
> She cried when someone died? Damn bro you right she's the best character <@!521783526878609418> Reading comprehension. She cried over her dead mentor. However, her character was way more than just crying from sadness in that page. She was showing her character, her relation to Pedro, her relation to Sanji, how she thinks it isn't his fault and doesn't blame him, how she understands what Pedro would have wanted, how she wants to follow it but the emotions are more than she can control. That's creating layers to a character, something Oda does well.
Also strawman arguments would be greatly appreciated out of here
That's not an opinion
You simplified an argument
But it is done
My part of this convo was not about her joining, but about the claims made to her character
Kaido will say "FINALLLYYYY" and kill himself
Depends tho
What if Kaido a little man inside that big body being controlled by an evil genius? As I said, depends
Kyoshiro was obviously Denjiro and it happened that way

> <@!274366418223497217> ya but if we can't argue about power levels then what is there left to talk about? <@!272064319661801473> There's a lot of Thousand Sunny details to be known
I bet yall don't know how many toilets there are in the Sunny for example
> how do i subscribe to daily thousand sunny facts? <@!272064319661801473> Just see where I am, I'm the Thousand Sunny facts
> If you count the aquarium, 5 <@!173952257635778560> Locations. And aquarium does not count lol
The sunny has a toilet above the library. Two under both staircases that go to the helm. That's all, 3
Toilets not meaning bathrooms
Just the toilet
> Why do they need that many <@!419608704418054157> Too many people
Also, if someone is taking a bath in the giant bathroom and another is just pooping right at the entrance, the smells will not be great
The toilet above the library is a different room from the bathroom. Under the stairs is just toilets. In the entrance of each room there is a little place with a sink to wash hands, brush your teeth etc
Everyone should know this info
Basic knowledge. How will I build my real life Thousand Sunny and live in it if I don't even know where I'd put the toilets? pfft
For the toilets under the stairs and the sinks
> But I think strawhats boys might occasionally have like a group bath like alabasta or whatever <@!419608704418054157> Idk about that, but they do wash all their clothes together in the same place. Nami and Robin wash theirs every day
People with specific rooms to work on: Franky, Usopp, Chopper, Sanji (kitchen) Jinbe stays at the helm. Nami makes her maps at the library. Robin stays at the library studying too. Luffy just goes on the head and Zoro spends time training at the big boy room ALL THIS MEANS BROOK NEEDS A PIANO
Petition for a piano in the Sunny
> Wait there’s no cartography room? <@!272064319661801473> In the library, Nami has her own desk. Also, everyone has books there expect Luffy (maybe Jinbe now)
The library is a pretty cool place bro
Yes, but she gets a cool desk
Nah, Nami likes to look outside bro. She needs a place where she can do that. Usopp, Franky, Sanji and Chopper don't have that panoramic view. Also the library is quiet, unless the toilets below are full and people need to go up. Being in a separated block helps too
> usopp got a whole room for his slingshot <@!272064319661801473> Him and Franky do a lot of shit tho
> Damn Giolla <@!521427565492305931> I remember watching that with fear my precious Sunny would stay like that
Also, Gerumpel, Franky listened to the SHs' requests. So Nami wished to stay there
He does tho
He builds his weapons and builds weapons for other SHs
He also must help with fixing weapons on the ship, like the cannons
Yes. Nami isn't someone who stays in a place like that without a window bro
Nah, they do different stuff bro
She has a pretty cool place to do her work
> easy, move the library to usopp's factory <@!272064319661801473> Don't do that to Robin and Nami bro. They like to be there
> zoro reads? <@!272064319661801473> "How to clean your sword" probably
BRUH
We are discussing Sunny details
And others are discussing Katakuri
I know a lot about the Sunny, I should stop
Tell me what you wish to know
LOL Yamato a blacksmith
> Idk what do you wanna tell me about <@!564773067969265674> So we talked about Sunny having three toilets (one below each stair that goes to the helm - so 2 - plus the one above the library, one bathroom (above the library) and that the boys' room and the girls' both have sinks at the entrance to wash hands, brush teeth, etc.  Then we talked about the workplaces of each Straw Hat  Usopp and Franky both have a workshop at the basement Sanji gets the kitchen Chopper has an infirmary  Jinbe now has the helm. Nami has her own desk at the library to draw her maps and Robin stays at the library studying too. Luffy just does his thing on the head. Zoro trains at the gym that exists above the mast But Brook has no PIANO. HOW DOES BROOK NOT HAVE A PIANO
Nami seems to like those big ass baths, like she says on the way to FMI
> Have we seen anyone in one piece brush his/her teeth? Idr <@!736943713439449099> We know it happens bc Oda wrote so on the blueprints. The boys' room has tooth brushes there.
<:RobinSmug:485147535875244032>
BTW Sunny had a pool... had.... we need it back
Chopper in the pool, what a chad
> Only one other cat has it If we don't count Zepo, who is currently imprisoned. Nami had an invisibility technique, but non-canon in the anime
Not Zepo ahhh
Zeo
> Nami's invisibility is canon <@!114296407816404992> It is? Hm.. My mind bamboozled me
Well in EL I thought she was one of the clones
Not completely invisible
But I guess I'm wrong
> But she never made herself invis or used the clones after that <@!576551753496002571> She was invisible in the anime in FMI. Need to check the manga
Is that image the source for the Ryou=Advanced Armament? tss
Don't want to derail convo there, so <@!134857202446893056> <@!114296407816404992> this is what I was talking about. She is one of the clones in EL

What does Kumadori have in his abilities that relates to Wano?
Oh so aesthetics
> And they may not have a concept of observation either tbh <@!114296407816404992> Knowing how they specialized in swords, I'd guess as much
They can use observation, but might not understand it. In Sky Island they didn't understand armament (or they'd have some chance to go against Enel), but they knew observation pretty well. Cultures will be cultures
Marco Costa
> Doesn’t kaido know what haki is <@!564773067969265674> He does, but he's been on that island for 20 years bro, he'll speak like Wano people a bit
No
Hyo just learned what haki was when Luffy talked about armament
He says "haki" and not "armament haki" bc he just learned the word

**More Kiku** and Hiyori
> No need for this color type of haki <@!376748967137902594> The colour when Hyo and Luffy use advanced haki or those auras like Zoro has in the anime?
In the anime, advanced haki is like it is in the manga bro
That's your opinion
Oda literally has an aura in the manga for advanced haki
> Oden overflowing with some shit aura and kaido too they do it with luffy vs kaido <@!376748967137902594> Those auras were strange, Zoro one seems to be an addition too. But advanced haki looks cool

Oda already said that experienced CoC users can pick who to spare. So there are already ways to make your CoC better. If we will get advanced techniques is smth else

No one can cry, it's actually impossible
Your expectations may be influenced by the environment, but your expectations are your fault in the end, at least in this situation. So people saying "oh he cried, I thought a scabbard would die, and that youtuber said we shouldn't see spoilers, man this chapter didn't need that, I was so hyped" are just showing they chose to use those clues to create high expectations
Imagine not knowing who lil Chouchou, the cutie is

> Unless having multiple moons changes some part of the show, it's entirely irrelevant <@!114296407816404992> Would you say the same about Sunny details?
But Sunny details give me joy
Different cycle durations. the OP moon doesn't have to be as far from their planet as the moon is to us
> the op world is not that technologically advance <@!495255829369454612> It is more than use in some things, less in others

But yeah, it's fine to assume OP's earth is not the center of the universe, but it isn't crazy to claim the contrary
> Ig but if you wanna say that none of our physics apply to one piece than literally everything we know of most of one piece would be different <@!521783526878609418> Not really, why would that be?
> The gravational force needed to literally everything would be different <@!521783526878609418> Not if Oda says "the force is the same on OP's world"
No, Oda can say "only on earth the force is the same"
That's lack of imagination
Yeah. But I still go with one moon bc that's all we've been shown. Until there's a clear indication of more than one, I won't change that opinion. However, it's more than possible that there are a lot of moons
!hottake
All the moons shown were alone. When we see more than one moon at the same time, then we can falsify the claim that there is only one moon. Until then, I don't think we should claim there's more, even if the possibility remains
> I feel like in a world with people who can kick the air to walk on it multiple moons isn't that crazy <@!521783526878609418> Yeah it isn't

I don't give views to dumb videos. My will power is too strong due to continuous AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH meditation
> Because Usopp is using the weapon he used when he was Sogeking in the colorspread, thus, Sogeking will return <@!274366418223497217> Yes, Oda was just practicing how to draw that again. Genius
> Brook has a piano key shirt, thus Brook wl fight Apoo <@!274366418223497217> That's a wrong one. That means Brook will finally have a piano inside Sunny, like I've been requesting to the gods since the beginning of time
> Maybe it’s not crows but he chooses to make crows out of his logia substance <@!564773067969265674> Hmmmmmm... plasticine logia. But has he has all the colours, it is always black bc they are all mixed
> <@!415999229564157955>  tf is plasticine <@!564773067969265674> I just translated it using google uh... Stuff that play-doh is made out of
Bro, u never played with this?
Yeah, neither have I
> Jimbei wearing orange signifies that Bepo will be relevant as a Sulong because Bepo also wears orange <@!274366418223497217> Oden too... maybe he'll return
That youtuber made the video like that on purpose so that people go click, man's gotta eat
Hello

In this channeç
Buy? Like the volumes?
Pfft, idk, I know how to in my country. Maybe Amazon? Those big boxes with a lot of volumes are the cheapest if u want all the series
My favorite scene was the minks one
Damn, I wonder what you'd find inside those to be so cheap
Imagine having a channel where you discuss One Piece and not knowing One Piece
Imagine making a color spread analysis and relating it to the story
Get well soon, Strong-Right

Is that Youtuber always like that?
Then why bother?
Fucking zoomers
Watch Sanada, the dude who appears in the SBS a lot and has the largest collection of OP. He flexes the collection and uses a mask, bet that Sawyer dude does this
> did i read a different chapter??? <@!206896898215378945> You didn't see the moon made out of rocks?
Tough question
DON
<#522036834310815744>
You need to go to <#522036834310815744>  and get roles <@!742532068608704532>
He dead
Ha but Chopper wouldn't. Gottem
Depends lol
"You should know this"
Looked

And those without waifu pics

Raizo looked real cute, now he is all badass. People grow
3 sword < 2 knifes and a pistol
Gear 5 Loranji Man
Sanji admits defeat tho
Sanji admits defeat
> I think Chopper needs more time to shine lately he is been useless <@!742532068608704532>
We only don't hear about diseases almost killing the crew often after Nami in Drum Island bc of Chopper
> everyone with a tendou pfp is bad <@!248949219564584962> Everyone who knows who that is is bad
> honestly I think monster point for a whole fight would be kind of lame <@!491390898031296532> That's why we need Monster Horn Point
> no ones reading that <@!474659436804177930> I speedread it. Gottem
Zoro's arc was Romance Dawn, don't fool yourselves
He is fire
Plants die with fire
Ricardo loses
Some morals... Morality itself is subjective. To him, he could be doing the most moral thing
If you compare to the mainstream view of morality irl, almost none of the OP characters behaves in a moral way. Some worse than others
> If he was the good guy he would want peace <@!698761447835959337> Luffy is a bad guy
> But even real life morals are not that great <@!564773067969265674> Well I'm biased to agree, but it's a good way to compare
Nah she is bad. If you want to end racism but kidnap and force men to have children with you, you're bad
> Luffys liberated one to many countries to be a bad guy <@!698761447835959337> But he wants war, so your own definitions are flexible, which takes from their validity
Not how it works
If the bad guys create the war, sure. If you create the war, who's the bad guy?
> Were the marines bad for wanting to execute ace? <@!703504844903940096> For sure
> Yeah but it's war against the bad guys <@!698761447835959337> War itself is bad unless it's a necessity. You should be arguing that it is a necessity, not that they are fighting the bad guys. "Bad guys" is relative. That's the mentality that creates unnecessary wars
> luffy on the other hand released soo many criminals <@!703504844903940096> Something obviously bad
> it was buggy that released most of the criminals <@!297795816255389697> Without Luffy, Buggy wouldn't have done shit
Yeah, for most Akainu is seen as a force for good, even if he kills those who oppose him and uses the death penalty
> a lot of people in the east blue had smaller goals Not the chad Krieg
Buggy had a map to the grand line and he kinda likes treasure, I think the raid in Orange Town was meant to be temporary
> <@!415999229564157955> Kaidos ruinied one to many countries to not be the bad guy <@!698761447835959337> I'm not arguing that he is not the bad guy. I'm saying Luffy is not a good guy
At most he is neutral
> would luffy help a country where he didnt like anyone <@!703504844903940096> X for doubt
WB yeah
What does Bonney do? Steal food?
She was all scared bc of some CDs
Krieg is a real pirate
Good in relation to what? Other pirates?
If so, sure
Kidd is not the most pirate like, because he cares about his own crew too much. A real pirate like BB and Krieg can't care less
Pirates aren't just savages who like hurting people, they are people who don't care about the way to get power. They steal ships and kill to gain treasure. They do not see their crews as something that important
> a crew of savages would fall apart super fast  Depends if there's a cult of the leader of sorts. Vikings on mushrooms could do their thing pretty well
Franky le badass
Jinbe was carrying Nami and Chopper, therefore those will almost die and be saved by Jinbe <:CrocoKidZoom:661610502543114290> yes, I'm a OP theorist
That spread is linked to Ace's death for sure, it seems to deliberate not to
Luffy didn't change enough to have a fleet officially under his name like Lord Buggy
Lack of strength caused him not to save Ace, it didn't cause the death itself, though for Luffy there's no difference
So that person being used as Kaido was actually BM?
they aren't canon
they weren't written by Oda
What's canon is Ace left Dawn Island, he formed the Spade Pirates, he went into the new world, he met shanks, he fought Jinbe, he fought WB and went in his crew, he tried to kill WB multiple times... That's all canon and is in the novel too, the rest isn't
the wiki says it is canon, it isn't
The source is it not being made by Oda and not being any different from other supervised works
If Oda says "this all happened in the story", then it's canon
> Can we agree its half canon then lol <@!593768510304288768> Enlightened Centrism
It was not a compliment
Debunked
> never shows the marines with haki <@!160778857702490113> It clearly shows some of them are not running
Orochi has too much confidence
Wano, Jinbe, cool dude in Alabasta
> What did ace achieve ? As a character <@!564773067969265674> Everything in his childhood with Luffy and Sabo; created a crew, became a supernova, met Shanks; he and Jinbe fought for 5 days, where they made a cool connection; he was one of WB's commanders; he tried to kill WB multiple times - at least - which tells us about his personality; he then saw one of his subordinates killed a member of the family and went out of his way to get him; his intro in Drum Island was cool af with him stopping the snow; then in Alabasta he was the cool bro - destroying the ships and stopping Smoker, fought BB finally, just to know BB was now a lot more powerful than before; and then everything that leads to the war; we now know he was in Wano and made connections there too. Also we know a lot about his thoughts on Roger. So he is a pretty complex character.
Big Mom is really cool
If you have to diverge conversation to a video, do you really hold any arguments? Can't you formalize them?
His tattoos tho
Cool transformation
It's easier to have someone react when there is already a reaction. Small brain moves tho
It's easier just to bet mutes
It's not like I'll be able to come here often once college starts, so I just bet mutes all the way <:KataLUL:562005179571109888>
"Not Stoopid" would be the only one for me
> I'll bet that carrot won't join the crew and if she does all of you could decide my new name <@!521783526878609418> Forever?
Join is a Straw Hat
Carrot won't join
Big brain
> can we get a #bets up in here <@!390376167636467722> Necessary for public display of bets
I've bet that the new raid suit is inside the lighter
> who else could have been the 1st commander then ? <@!328936254978916352> me
Maybe one of those who became captains on their own was a commander
pls stop
Stop shitposting misinformation
yes
> episode of sabo didnt gave any information <@!161069447858094080> It had a sekushi Sabo
Imagine losing arguments
You only lose arguments if you claim wrong stuff is right. If you say what you remember is something and ask for clarification, you win when you know it was wrong. Just claim stuff you're sure about
Easy
> Hey guys I don't remember for sure so clarify for me why Zoro personality is better than Sanji? <@!521783526878609418> Subjective
I don't take sides in dumb fights
Best way to learn is in real fights
> All I am asking is.... Imagine Zoro without scars would he look better? <@!306372168827273216> His scars tell a story, so I don't think so
BINGO - inserts lung cancer
> Guys.... It's scars we are talking about not tattoo? <@!306372168827273216> Yes, we like scars
As I said, scars tell stories in OP's world
Nami tattooed over it. But she used to be shown with a scar behind the actual tattoo
Chopper, Law and Marco
My body is fragile
> Nami's got a scar on her back that isn't tattoed <@!114296407816404992> It was shown a lot pre-ts, but I don't remember seeing that one post
It's sad that she doesn't have the scar anymore

From chap 105
Chopper just made his boom boom clap thing
Yeah I was gonna show that
She risked it
This is what Bean will say when all of us leave btw
It's implied
Manga is portuguese (probs other languages too) for mango
Also sleeve
> arabic too Does it mean sleeve too?
Apoo's hair is cool
Kiku
lol
Killer = Zoro in beauty
I wonder when Oda will introduce Ricardp
The Marines have fish-man in their bases wym
As criminals tho
No kink shaming
Haha didn't get me
yeehaw
> since when? chapter 1
Sanji saving Momo would make me reconsider my disgust for his previous actions
Mr. Mask will come
It isn't sad for you
Oh, look, a person crying after seeing his brother's death boohoo
> luffys such a crybaby booohoo <@!742887438720172235> I'm judging this claim, not your emotions
You are arguing in a publicly acessible group
Chopper is the actual Mr. Prince btw
Don't watch the anime then
In this channel, we are
ew
> I like anime. Easier to edit-out filler parts than cutting-out parts of manga. <@!263517029284184064> Bro what?
Manga fillers bro
LOL
He has what it takes to be the leader of the SHs, that's it
Reread
