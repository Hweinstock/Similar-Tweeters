Or they were just too powerful to arrest
Kaido was actually captured at one point
He may not have gone free after that battle
Well, King
This is a literal suicide mission
They won't die from Sulong, but they did go there specifically to die if they had to against Kaido
They'll just suffocate him with corpses
Easiest victory <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Depends on the smile
There doesn't seem to be a set rule for how a power actually manifests, just the negative side effects
Yeh king, it's a possibility, but I also doubt the moon will be out for the entire fight too
I figure Kaido would let them go for a bit, then block it out at some point
Hell, Big Mom has even more ability to block it out than he does
She could make a full on raging storm if she wanted
Big Mom knows about Sulong already, she'll know exactly what's up
I wouldn't be surprised if Kaido didn't know tho
Drake is a sword member, and he's *in* the raid already
But, trust me, you can look anywhere and find those. People have been wanting any and every character you could possibly name to show up to this fight
They've been trying to get Blackbeard to go somewhere since Dressrosa
Kaido wants war because he's bored lol
zeph
NO.
Doom, how could you forget about Speed? The fastest character in the manga
Jack just has everything going for him <:CrocoKid:487633532907159552>
But why would another member coming convince you that the marines are?
They'd be coming with the marines anyway lol
Gazelleman lacks stamina
Everyone knows it's all about cross country
That's why Sanji's the fastest strawhat and not Luffy <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Break week, we don't need a channel for excess traffic without the excess traffic
It'll be back when needed, we keep an eye on things
It's a secret group in the marines, not a separate organization
So if Sword shows up, then the marines are going in by default
Unless for some reason they only seen the small group
It's the secret organization *of* the marines, yes they are in it lol
Groups like Sword usually do only have a few people in them, relative to the organization
It probably has less than 200 members, I imagine
Why would that be too much?
That'd be .2% of the marines
It's .2%, yes
This is a good bit less than one
The marines have around 100,000 members as of Marineford
Assuming they haven't increased drastically, a group in it with about 200 people would be around .2% of the organization
I don't get the doubt rofl
How many doctors even feature in One Piece to be able to make a list? lmao
I love it when I see shit like
"Top 4 Yonko"
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
It doesn't necessarily mean they are part of it, but they *are* part of the marines

It's not unconfirmed, they are the Marine HQ Sword
The worst arc of One Piece is probably still one of the best arcs in general manga <:LUL:321931602655707136>
I didn't have one in mind, just general praise there
I wish Jango and Fullbody got the Garp training too
Oh man, feel better bud ‚ù§Ô∏è Are you gonna try to get tested soon?
Nah, akainu wouldn't have gotten to the Strawhats before Kuma could save them

Zoro's a 1-3 sword style user, yeh
Santoryuu is just his strongest
Dax, there's a really good chance it's a temporary effect lol
She can probably only do it for long enough to chain someone up, not permanently
But also, she makes them weak and worthless
So if it's permanent, they're useless after <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Kinda like a nicer version of Kalifa's fruit, thinking about it
Oh no, I was just saying he has styles from 1-3 lol
I thought you were asking why anyone thought he had a two sword, lmao
That's something to ask in <#164971940648321024> more so than here, but it's just gone until we have a need for it
Break week for the manga and all
üëçüèæ
<@!373144491005313025> I can't recall, was it a mistranslation that he went for the level 6 people?
^
I can see that yeh
Yeh, they were the ones who caused Sengoku to resign
Because the government wanted to cover up so many people left level 6 but weren't with blackbeard
What a year that week was for him
There could have been, curiosity
they didn't have their own cells
They were chained in groups
Pfft when's the last time a president fought a war in office? <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Well, they wanted to keep sengoku and Garp to help raise the next generation
But Sengoku and Garp were particularly high profile people too
The marines are actually doing very well
That was driven home after the time skip
Apparently they're stronger than ever
That's such a big thing and it doesn't get enough recognition, wow
They can make Pacifistas
They can now manufacture armies of Warlord worthy poeple
Yeah, honestly that's probably one of the biggest things they brought out at Marineford
Nothing about it is confirmed except that it's Vegapunk's thing, mip
^
Kizaru's fruit is just a laser
So they could probably just shoot fire or freeze things too
Maybe even shoot molten metal or something
Like that's not even really copying a fruit power
It's just giving them flamethrowers and nitrogen guns <:LUL:321931602655707136>
That would be such a bad idea, wow lmao
Even if they only get the downside, that's still kind of terrifying
A smiling cyborg coming to kill you with a giant laser lmao
But, if they get the powers
Imagine the ones with sentient parts <:LUL:321931602655707136>
All the chapter day and rule commands, lol
There is no difference between Kuma before and after he lost his mind, that we know
There is not lol
He really didn't seem able to
Bigblue, can you provide pages to indicate this sentiment?
That's literally what I just asked you to do <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Nope, you can grab pages
No scenes lmao
You cannot
No, and no other series references pls
If you can't provide scans and panels, it's not a supported argument rofl
Hang on, work call
No it's not, the anime can't clarify the original source lmao
It is not lol
Pasta's right i'm js
What do they think doing these things will accomplish?
Give us something to do in the day? lol
Who said Roger couldn't beat him?
rofl
We eating fire in here?
His head being fine doesn't mean Roger didn't beat the shit out of him, tho
Lao G didn't break his head and still beat him
Garp's the one we know for sure couldn't <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Nah, just that it's his most important weapon
Dude was more than capable of throwing a great punch too lol
jamon...jamon...jamon...jamon...
Nep*tyooon*
But that's not a fact, that's your estimation
We don't know that Roger ever even tried
Now, what we do know for sure
Is that Garp didn't use nearly the level of haki on Chinjao that Roger used on Whitebeard
And yet, Garp still couldn't beat him until then
No, it was training lmao
I love that apologizing for him tho <:LUL:321931602655707136>
He himself points out that he does it so that he can break Chinjao's horn
You assume Roger couldn't, vegito
But we know for a fact Garp couldn't
We also know for a fact Roger and Whitebeard were the strongest <:LUL:321931602655707136>
No, I'm just not claiming one way or the other
It makes perfect sense that he didn't try to, tho
Luffy didn't even try until the very last hit of their match
Because he wouldn't need to?
If he can blow away Chinjao without even touching his horn, why go through the trouble?
Yeah, and beating down Chinjao and his entire crew is plenty fun
^
You're assuming they fought at all <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Yeh, let's grab some panels
This was a magazine thing tho
https://i.redd.it/rqxvofp25jx41.jpg
This is the whole page, and disclaimer, I cannot read Japanese to save my life
But, I do not see Roger's picture here, and I haven't seen a mention of him in a translation for this yet
Someone help source pls
Yeh, I believe it only recaps the fight and adds how Garp couldn't beat Chinjao before the training, but they'd fought a few times before
Oh, apparently they fought before Roger was even the King
lmao
30 years back
Well...it is lol
This is piracy

Nux Taku is the most annoying, shallow minded dude I've ever seen on youtube
That's not saying much, I don't watch many youtubers
Especially One Piece ones
But ugh
Dude was never funny to me, rofl
He feels like a neckbeardier artur to me
I love reviews more than theorists
He's useful for extra material translations if they're accurate, for sure
Does he fil? I haven't heard any yet <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Ehh I don't really do podcasts either
I'm not opposed, but I don't like shallow theories
They don't have to be correct or even plausible, just something with a little more thought than
"Zoro's gonna unlock conqueror's haki in Wano CONFIRMED!"
No, middle east?
I'll brb tho

ohbutwhydontthemarineskilltheemperorstholul
I'd prefer if you guys wanted to keep talking about the series to do so in <#513312224048185345> just in case, dunno if anyone's reading that <@!196038600565981185>
No clue what it is tho
It was a joke about that panel, mip <:LUL:321931602655707136>
The balance is important to the government for a reason

I just realized
That's San Juan Wolf
Wolf? Probably, I remember there was that panorama when Magellan mentioned Whitebeard and everyone wanted him dead there
His fruit lets him increase his size
That'd be his actual size
Ages ago, vivre card I think?
Well, he sank it, so not well <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Or, broke it anyway
Well, they didn't steal a ship, that was something blackbeard regretted
They tried to barter a ship for him lol
^ It was probably Garp
Apparently they all had a grudge against Whitebeard too, so it could've even just been clean up after a fight with him lol
No, the one who put the people in level 6
Not helping bonney rofl
I imagine it's between Garp, Sengoku and the current admirals
Half birthday, lmao
ffffffffff birthdays
I do, and I will explain why in a sec <@!107217661628301312>
<@!107217661628301312> Aight sorry, work call. So I don't think Kaido's got as much of an information network as Big Mom only because his people don't seem as organized as she's been so far
For example, he somehow didn't even know Kinemon and the Scabbards were still around despite Doflamingo fighting them directly
Though he does seem to have a bunch of underworld connections and deals going on, I think he's got the funding side more than the recon side
Maybe similar in scope as far as having a similarly large group of territories, I could see that
But maybe not as dedicated, since Big Mom even has homies who can pass things to napoleon and straight to her
Oh yeh, she's got it on lock. But she's also unique with the homies advantage, so they may do like a rough version
But she's a little broken as far as that goes

Oh yeh, are you guys up for games today?
i'm off in about 3 hours, but I have the night off
Dragon/dark
Doom
The entire first half of the series had them going island to island for no reason at all, and the very first island in the New World, they went to for no reason
Just wanting to go because Usopp wants to is more than enough reason, lol
Yeh, the log, not plot
Punk Hazard, they did go to for no reason
It was literally just because it seemed the most dangerous, and therefore most fun, to Luffy
And then from there, rest of the next decade was set, lol
They went to Punk Hazard because of the call, and because it seemed dangerous to them
Yes, like I said
Because it seemed dangerous and therefore the most fun to Luffy <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Oh true pasta, Alabasta they did go to for a reason
forgot that was basically the first round of Punk Hazard --> Dressrosa
Yeh mip exactly
if Luffy wants to go, they'll go, they've never *needed* a reason
Not at all
Nothing ends when they find One Piece except the race to find it
Luffy still has to adventure around, and Elbaf is important to some degree
But also, yeh, all he has to do is want to go
Not like there's a time limit for getting to Laugh Tale
That'd be interesting, vain
Minus the death lmao
Kinemon would stand no chance against Doflamingo
That he can seemingly use a new form of haki doesn't mean he can suddenly take people who don't seem to know it
> I mean we did get a sneak peek of that directly outside the colosseum bean, where doffy wrecked kin <@!142923564423577601> Oh yeh, I forgot that lmao
Is TheOriginalLuffy BDA? They post the new video in promote yourself every time it's out
The inherited haki is probably exactly what it is tbh
Especially given this series' insistence on inherited will being a driving force for people
Not like he bestowed it, but they're picked up his dream and it's molded their haki to be as great as his was
Non-ryuo attacks can work on them
It's just really, really, *really*  hard
Could have, sure vegito
No reason they couldn't
Luffy could've easily broken the collar
The problem was it would've gone off before he could take care of it lol
Yeh laww, I had a little essay about that yesterday I think
How it's nice that Wano's philosophy in swordsmanship is built on nuance and subtlety over straight power
Luffy was used to having to concentrate his haki and punch with his fist
As opposed to just letting it flow to an area
Yes gaime
Of course, lmao
<@!274366418223497217> Y'know, he does mention it back when Luffy does it, but I don't think he ever goes back to that theory after Sabaody lol
Now, there is a *heavy* bit of evidence that it was the higher form of it
There's just no completely direct confirmation is all
Oh yeh zeph, is he doing the post-war arc tomorrow too?
Or just Marineford?
wtffffff
Just do to it justice?
Guys, One Piece chat here pls
<#513312224048185345> If you wanna talk about Avatar's development
Well yeah
His crew is just made of people he beat
lol
I love it lmao
Yes kazuma
It is as of Marineford, anyway
Why would that be foolish? It's not like we know what Blackbeard wants at all
All we know is he wants fruits, having to fight Big Mom for one isn't worth it
Like, the Kage Kage does almost just as well anyway
At Water 7, Garp's crew knew about it
At Marineford, it was announced to everyone
Not that Dragon is Garp's son, but that he's Luffy's father
And everyone knows Garp is Luffy's grandfather, so 2 and 2
No, Whitebeard was actually a huge thing for him
He admired him for his strength, and seemed to want to be him
It was, he wanted the strength he'd admired for years
The Gura Gura was the key to it
And he killed him to declare his age
<@!319602380041879552> No, you misunderstood
I mean he told them at Water 7, no one actually knew before then
and at Marineford, *everyone* knew because they were told
And it's easy to put together that Luffy's dad is probably Garp's son
No, he did it for a personal reason too. It wasn't just a dispassionate killing, he grew disappointed in Whitebeard's decline of power and wanted to usurp him
Ace was nothing personal, Whitebeard was his entire goal before getting to be an Emperor himself
Some people didn't even think Dragon existed until recently
The Archipelago was actually right next door lol
That's why it was so dangerous to be uppity around for pirates, and why Kizaru could get there so fast
Right as he's assaulting him, hang on

<@!155760010410983424> Yeah, it didn't have to be personal, he just made it personal. But everything he did was in reference to Whitebeard's age being over and all, if it were anyone it would've been the same, but he was looking to take that seat from Whitebeard
^ also yeh lmao
Even though Sentoumaru and some Pacifistas can show up

It'd be A
What's that?
I can see why that would be a compelling argument marc
But I would think that in that situation, you really would be fine
Yeh, relativity plays into this lol
I'm gonna have to think about this for a sec, but I wanna still say A
I can see how it would be both tho
Mkay, so it would be A
And here's my reasoning
In the dick example, there's a structure that is still moving through the portal
So relatively speaking, the thing is basically coming out of the ground at 1 million miles an hour through the other side. But with the cube, there's nothing acting past it going into the portal, so it should just kind of plop out but not fly out, I feel
And since there's no big difference in motion between the two frames, I don't think there would be enough energy in either to have it flying off
As opposed to someone pretty much running themselves through with a sword lmao
But then, I really can see it going B as well for the exact opposite reason too lmao
I'm gonna stick with A based on that tho, there just doesn't feel like there are enough factors to make it go flying versus just a quick piddle off
Yeh, energy is relative, so that does make sense
And if the portal were going fast enough, I can see it falling a good distance, but I don't think it would full on fly off
Especially since gravity is changing vectors for it
Yeh, it'd be B, relativity really plays into it lol
It's all relativity, looking at it I wanna treat it like you're just putting a circle over the box
But it actually is moving through space
Or, space is moving through it rather, which amounts to literally the same thing
Yeh, I wanna say someone thought of that problem before too
But like before the game Portals was made
Youss is right
And yes, just don't talk about the content in other channels
And preferably stay in the manga channels more than others
You mean inconclusive?
Being as accurate to IRL as we can be, and assuming this is the standard definition of a portal
It'd have to be B
Yeh, if portal mechanics are the equivalent of just throwing a hula hoop over something, then it stays still
If it's an actual bending of space and time, that creates momentum and energy from a certain reference frame
Fun fact, that's one of the theoretical secrets to FTL travel
Yeh, you've gone faster than light to everyone looking at you
but, to you yourself, you've only taken a step over a threshold
So there's no violation of physics
You can't go the speed of light in your own reference frame
You can't exceed it in anyone's reference frame unless you've got a time machine
I wanna say yes, but not because of time dilation there

It's there somewhere.'
Buggy's crew included the many, many people he had working under him as mercernaries
Which included over 200 high level prisoners from Impel Down
I feel like that'll be Buggy's first safe refuge if he has to stay in the New World
Begrudgingly, extremely begrudgingly
To be fair, they thought they killed him
<@!96965684428283904> We do know the power relation, Jack was about even with both of them
He couldn't beat them any more than they could beat him
That's reinforced when Jack does to fight Ashura Douji in Wano and goes toe to toe with him, and later Inuarashi and Ashura Douji are confirmed equal as well
They weren't weaker than Jack
That's why he couldn't beat them, either lol
Yeah, for the most part it does
This wasn't like a gimmicky fight where you need to pay attention to context or anything
This was a straight up brawl between two straightforward fighters
And Jack couldn't put either of them down after 12 hours of fighting either of them
It's driven home even further in Wano, Oda's kind of gone out of his way to frame where Jack is in relation to the scabbards
Because Inuarashi,  Nekomamushi and Ashura Douji were all confirmed as strong as him, indirectly and directly
They didn't have to take breaks at all
They *chose* to
The option was brought up not to take breaks and keep on fighting, they chose their cycles over Jack's invasion
Like, I have 0 doubt at all that Inuarashi and Nekomamushi can fight for multiple days as well
As powerful as they are, when potentially much weaker characters have
If Jack were going to win at the last hour, he would have won the very next fight
Clearly he could not damage them enough to actually tip the fight in his favor at al
That, and the whole 1v1 instead of 2v1 on him
rofl
Nah, the full moon was a good week away
'cause it doesn't happen until WCI
Diddy you're disagreeing with a fact here lol
Unless Jack just decided to hold back, anyway
Doen, please.
there are 12 moons
Oh no, the going for a week is based on my own estimation. Everything else is based on direct statement or inference from the series
And literally all signs point to them being even, and that was reiterated in Wano lol
It is a fact, tho
hang on, lemme grab some pages
About a week to WCI

I like how Luffy makes it sound like the dukes fought Batman or something lmao

He fought them one at a time and could not take them out
What are you talking about lmao
It's not possible, mip
Inuarashi alludes to looking forward to being able to use it against Jack next time
And the full moon happens just about a week later, in WCI
inb46moons
But yeh, they were approaching it, but hadn't gotten to it just yet
But we know without it, Jack couldn't beat them
He was about even with them, according to the series
So with it, they probably would wreck him
Unless he has some augmentation he didn't actually use against them
I hope we don't get some shit like Jack was holding back his strongest form against the dukes
lmao
goddammit doen rofl
I hope Luffy one shots Jack

Come on now.
So it looks like there's a fire growing near me, and I may have to evac but no one's told us yet
But if so, I may be gone the next few days, I'll still have my phone so I'll keep you guys posted
Really hoping we don't have to 'cause I have a cat and that makes it a little harder, since my roomie can't take her <:crocoSweat:674289849314050098>
It's at 25 acres and 10% contained apparently, I'm not sure how good those numbers are but I've seen thousands of acres burned so here's hoping lmao
Sakazuki is probably the head of Sword because he's the Fleet Admiral, lol
If you mean Sakazuki's comment on them, it doesn't really make sense in general
Since reporting in at all would mean the marines would find out
So either there's no real way of indicating their strength to him or he's not really there to report on it, so he doesn't
It's been super windy over here lately, but it seems like they got to it early enough that it's not too bad
thankfully
Adam, what I was saying before was that if the samurai of Wano were a key issue as far as a decision Sakazuki had to make
By now, he'd know exactly how strong they are if that's information Drake's supposed to be getting
Whether he leads Sword or not
Yes, but he's the Fleet Admiral
Just by the fact that Drake knows these things, he should know
It's not like Sword would be doing things independently of Sakazuki's benefit entirely, it's a marine group
So somehow the fleet admiral didn't get information from Sword?
I feel like it's more likely that Drake just can't accurately relay the strength of the samurai beyond numbers
No, I'm asserting Drake just doesn't have the information to give, if he does there's no way Sakazuki wouldn't know about it
But how? This isn't like a government agency not giving information to the president, this is a military group within a military group
Their chain of command, as far as we can possibly tell, ends at Sakazuki
Like, this is *his* group
Yeh, so Cipher Pol keeping info from the marines and vice versa makes sense
Those are two different groups who may even be softly at odds in a lot of ways
But this is a group only Sakazuki could be in charge of, in an ultimate sense
Unless somehow they report only to Kong or something?
Which is a possibility still, I can't disregard it, but I feel like it's unlikely
So far no word on the website for how, I'm guessing it was someone hiking and throwing out a cigarette or something though
It was in a high traffic recreational hiking area
But it wasn't numbers they didn't know, it was the strength of those numbers
But also, Drake may not have that information
Orochi is under no obligation to share how many samurai he has under him
Not a big secret, just information no one's cared to get, so no one really has
It just seems extremely unlikely that a group within the marines is operating without any total line of information to Sakazuki
Even if not directly, just by being a marine group and having the knowledge, it's impossible for Sakazuki to not be getting it
Because otherwise, wtf would they possibly be doing with what they gather? rofl
But the problem is, if Drake has the information and it's *not* getting to Sakazuki
What use is it at all?
For what? If another admiral has it, now would be the time that Sakazuki gets it
What could an admiral do with that information that Sakazuki couldn't?
Really, why would they be keeping it from him even now when this is a specific piece of info he needs?
How would they know?
They don't just watch Sakazuki 24/7 rofl
^
But also, if the marines aren't using the info, why is it even being gathered?
It's clearly not a government branch, so it's not like they're leaking it to the Gorosei
It kind of does though
And if they are without his input, they're heavily, *heavily* nerfing themselves
Because no matter who the head of that group is, Sakazuki has more power and more resources
That's really all it comes down to for me, why would they weaken themselves so hard by not giving Sakazuki everything they have when he can then swing everything *he* has at the issue?
Acting independently of the marines a few times is wholly different than an entirely separate organization being run
Or that's just information that Drake doesn't know
he's part of Kaido's crew after all, not Orochi's gang
He's reporting on the piracy, not the samurai
Yeah, but the marines haven't been able to get it
I'm sure they're more interested in the fact that Kaido is there, and Oden is from there
The only sensible thing to me is that they just don't have the info yet more so than Sakazuki somehow can't access it
They tried, choc
Ages back, Ryuma was apparently a big factor in stopping them
But that's why they know they can't do it, presumably
I'm sure now would be different, between Kaido sucking the resources of the land and people away and the marines getting the Pacifistas and SSG
You'd think you'd know better by now <:LUL:321931602655707136>
That's how it goes a good bit of the time, the most power hungry folks usually end up being destroyed by their greed
We've confirmed that death releases the fruit, and that seems to be their goal either way
Judging by Devon's word, Burgess's actions, and blackbeard not being able to take Ace's fruit while he was alive
Literally no matter which two fruits he gets, that we know in the series, if he has two at once he'll probably be stronger than most others lol
Well, he advanced faster than Luffy could've ever dreamed of with it, so that's fun
Probably faster than anyone ever has tbh lol
Thing is, Marco's words are what kind of put that idea down
He pretty clearly indicated they had no plans or anything involving Wano the entire time
Which makes sense, not like pirates visit their friends constantly in this series, people go decades without seeing each other
If they were a particular problem for him, maybe
It was implied to be destroyed completely

Seems that it was both taken off maps and actually destroyed itsel
No, Whitebeard and Roger's clash was nowhere near island destroying
But, it did cause enough collateral damage that it uprooted trees, sent the crews flying and almost capsized the Moby Dick lol
^ They'll probably skip it
Since the only reason to go there seemed to be to find out what they did at Zou
It also seems that God Valley was destroyed, since Sengoku mentioned that it was both taken off maps *and* disappeared entirely
Even Ohara didn't get that rep
^
They really didn't seem to be holding back there either
they almost toppled Whitebeard's ship and sent a *lot* of folks flying lmao
^
You just find out about the poneglyphs yeh
Roger got there, revised his trip, and *then* headed straight for Laugh Tale
they didn't need to go to Lodestar again for it
Nah, they actually address this during Marineford
Whitebeard's crew just knows not to get in his way and protect themselves from him
So he's able to attack freely
Also yeh, they both loved a good fight
^ And technically, as much as they were friends, they were still enemies and the only rivals each other had
And being that this was the last time Roger could ever fight Whitebeard, I imagine he'd have wanted to make it memorable
After all, 3 days and nights of fighting is no light clash rofl
lmao
!purge 29
<@!228271420445163521> Lmao I thought you meant Whitebeard vs Roger up there too
Nah, there seemed to be the implication that shiki was comparable to Roger at least, if not as strong
Well, not as strong, we know that rofl
But Roger probably couldn't just one shot him, all things considered
Yes illu
Artur just put it out today <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Well, the weather was a lucky turn of events
It looked like it was brewing before the fight started, I think?
Eh, it kinda makes more sense for it to be
Only because it was a fight in the New World, after all
That kind of thing is normal
Not even like a freak incident or anything, you almost expect it lol
Lmao, I mean maybe somehow he did
Or even the egg did, idk
Sensed he was in danger of dying and causedit
Hey, you never know lmao
Yeh
I'm serious tho, that could be a thing
Maybe it was some kind of weather manipulating bird or something?
The whole reason the Grandline's weather is all fucked up
Kind of like how Fishmen can change ocean currents
So hyped about it
It's dropping soon yc
In half an hour?
12 EST I wanna say
I'm at work now, ugh
I'm waiting to take my break so I can start it lol
Pffft, not like an arc in One Piece? Have you seen his reviews? <:LUL:321931602655707136>
<@!107217661628301312> I'd be tired of it more if not for knowing that this really is his first read through
It is getting tiring that literally every arc but Thriller Bark has been escalating as his greatest manga reading experience ever
But I also really appreciate the sheer shock and awe he's displaying at it
Like it's validating why everyone loves the series instead of only hyping the cliche, power scaling or shounen tropes of it
Yeh, each and every arc except for Thriller Bark has been far better than the previous one for him
<@!380840459641159683> That was my greatest fear too
Hated that he started talking about the weirdest things for Moria
Like him giving up shadows was because he lost a battle of wills with the shadows?
Goddammit audience
He knows about Ace
He's already finished Marineford and the post-war arc
This vid is about Marineford, then the next will be for the post-war and I imagine return to Sabaody
But honestly, as short as the post-war arc is, there is SO much that goes on you could easily do a whole video on it
Oh it will evan
FMI and Thriller Bark will be his only disliked arcs
Yeh, the powers bit about Moria, I didn't care about at all for him
I just dislike that he focused on it and not Moria's development as a character and his motivations
Because those are touched on in the arc, and Moria's entire set of actions and techniques are all inspired by his fucked up PTSD mindset
Yeh, he mentioned it for a second, but all of his corrections fell right back onto why the final fight's conclusion was okay
Versus what he missed in the narrative
I'm not sure if he rates the arcs, does he?
Some do
Most don't
Moria's doesn't
So, Moria releases the shadows for two evident reasons
The first, out of spite
That's the least obvious one, since he seems to indicate that himself
The second, because he took too many in, was barely conscious, slightly deranged and was getting them beaten out of him
Like, he ate too much and started spewing them up because he couldn't keep them in check
Since he was damn near dead by then, really
But yeh, he didn't *have* to let them out
And when he gets the shadows, he has automatic total control over them, he can't really lose a battle of wills against the shadows lol
Did he YC? I didn't even notice that one, i'll have to go back
Nah, Zoro was running *to* pica
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOVzo4Vnc-w
<@!421882805702623263>
Oh, he said he'd be skipping the post war lol
i'm happy
Oh shit
50  minute video
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
So he gave plenty of time
lmao same pasta
ay otp

If anyone is interested
Tbh, Marineford goes by so fast
even though it really is a full arc
so a reread for me only ever takes like a day lol
Marineford had buildup over 5 different arcs, coded
lol
It's probably the most built up event in the series second to the raid at Wano
Marineford had its own build up stage, it's just the build up happened elsewhere
Okay I have to watch it now
I just can't not ugh
I'll have to just split it up between calls, dangit
They purposefully won't catch up
At worst we may have a couple of filler episodes like Water 7, that's about it
Bubbles?
Speech bubbles?
Yeh, Luffy's absolutely not getting higher than Roger
Maybe he'll leap over Shanks and Blackbeard, that's about the highest I can see being generous
It's almost an hour long
So that'll be a commitment
Just so you know, lol
Roger died before there *were* two Emperors to take down
lol
We also don't know if Shanks never did
Blackbeard, in fact, did take down an Emperor
And is the only Emperor known to have done so in his time
But two? I doubt Luffy's taking down two
Hell, I doubt Luffy's taking down one tbh, lmao
There's an entire alliance and a nation fighting here, Luffy's the most famous player to the outside world but not even the most important party here
But also remember, Law and Luffy got credit for Dressrosa equally
Hour long almost, doom
lmao
Doom
The FMI video will just be 10 minutes of Mark being pissed
"Hello, my name is TotallyNotMark, and Oda what the fuck did you do to Sanji?!"
I'm on and off between calls watching it
I'll give input after work when I can do it all at once again
Can you put a timer on the kick?
For something like that, a few days gone would be a good message
The way it flows off of his hair and skin is perfect, jeff
Oh yeh, I support a timed ban over a kick in that case
I thought we could kick for a soft ban on a timer
Neither
Because honestly, Akainu didn't really do *that* much to them
For Sabo, it should be a non issue, as devastating as it is it was a marine doing his job
He didn't put a hole through their chests, lol
Akainu being the one to do it shouldn't factor in as much
Do you think they'd have wanted revenge on the no name executioners if it happened without him?
Yeh, Luffy would have a much stronger grudge against Blackbeard than Akainu
Sakazuki just did his job, it was a completely impersonal killing really
Well, Spandam went out of his way to get Robin, and did some extremely underhanded things that personally damaged Franky at least
that's some stuff I imagine would get some revenge
but what Spandam did was basically Blackbeard's role in Marineford
Well, when I say personal I mean there was no history between them beyond the fact that Sakazuki had a pirate to kill
Like, personal between the people involved, not just a personal drive
As opposed to Blackbeard, who did all of that with betrayal in the start
Nah, Akainu hates them about the same, he just recognizes their danger
He doesn't even seem to hate them, I'd even call that too personal
He just seems to hate law breakers and they happened to be some
I don't know if I'd call even that personal
'cause *everyone* was hating them for it
I mean, it's Roger and Dragon
the fact that they exist is literally all the reason needed
You're not wrong, fats
Srsly
nah, Blackbeard wouldn't have even become an Emperor before dying
The only reason he managed to get as far as he did was because whitebeard wasn't around to stop him
Kaido and Big Mom would never have met again on good terms
since Luffy's the reason they're coming together <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Pre-skip I always used to say if you took the strawhats out, you'd still be able to have a full world turning without them and a complete plot and everything
Oda's worldbuilding was that good
But now, Luffy's grown so big I can't even say that anymore
Almost everything going on now is a direct consequence of something he's done, even as far as what's going on at Reverie
Or, what went on rather
^
Every single thing going on since FMI has been directly related to Luffy's own actions
Yeh doom, the Worst Generation are the only other characters who could carry the series now
And it'd be *radically* different to today's stuff
^
Not even the biggest tbh, more the most connected
So as soon as he turns, *soooo* many more do
He's 15 in mind lmao
honestly fats, Oda draws attention to that himself
Just by how many people liken him to Roger
*The* manliest man of all goddamn time
Whitebeard was the daddiest of men, sys
Roger was the manliest
And together, they were the greatest of all men <:LUL:321931602655707136>
