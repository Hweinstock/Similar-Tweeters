Imagine wanting to be Pirate King and not fighting the strongest to get there
That's why he has a crew with different abilities and is not by himself. He acknowledges he can't be Pirate King without them
His goal is to be the man with the most freedom, the king of the pirates. His goal comes from meeting Shanks, to whom he made the promess to become an even greater pirate than him
Chapter 1 stuff
We're talking about the manga bro
The first point is wrong because Luffy's personality evolves, especially when his brother died. He was always the guy who ran first into an enemy, but that proved not to be enough when his crew was defeated so easily by Kuma and once he saw he couldn't save his brother effectively. Therefore, he chose to change and give himself time to get better, something almost out of character. Luffy is also the guy who can read others' emotions and makes people rely on him with how much he cares about his friends and ignores the enemy's authority, as his goal requires him to defeat everyone in his way. However, Luffy understands that he can't do it alone, that's why he has a crew, and that's why he doesn't have to be the perfect MC
That's the style of the manga. If you can't bring yourself to like it, then that's it
LOL
Weren't the others real?

But aquarium makes a lot of sense
Don't do that, Doom, the fish-man anti-segregation police will come to get u
Sanji can just bring the drinks directly through the mast
It's a really cool place
But yeah, you know I'm a biased Sunny enthusiast so
Sunny is a lot cooler to understand and know just because it has more unique features
> sunny has 2 toilets <@!160778857702490113> 3* two below the stairs, one above the library
If by lookout you mean that round building behind the kitchen where the library and the bathroom is
The gym as no toilet

Y would Jinbe die
Why?
Oh yes the vibes
Give us a reason
Luffy aint letting a crew member die, or he'll not be PK
> If Jinbie dies, will you be surprised <@!237434464656031744> Yes, because he is a member of the crew
Jinbe isn't dying
If Jinbe is in the crew, then he can't die. That's it. Merry dying was enough
He mentioned it so u dum dums think he'll die
"Probably", yall don't know how to use that word
> Its a fair assumption to make as a theory tho<@!415999229564157955> <@!237434464656031744> Not how you use the concept of probability, though. What evidence is there that make that alternative more likely than others?
Possibility is not probability
You said that that possibility is more likely than others, thus probable. Which isn't the case unless there's evidence
> <@!415999229564157955> so you're saying you couldn't understand why the ope ope would have been used on Imu? <@!237434464656031744> If you continue to not understand what is being said, I'll quit trying to explain. You didn't say "Imu was *possibly* bestowed immortality by the original user", you said "*probably*". If you can't understand the difference in those statements and the need for evidence for the second, this conversation is over.
Not reaching, using the right words is important not to make false claims
You claimed probability
This is done
I'm not saying it was absolute, I'm saying you were saying it was something probable, which in itself is a claim
!os
How is that gay?
It's only valid if I understand what gay means there lol
oh, I see
> Man, the only thing you got out of what he said was one word? Lol <@!237434464656031744> I won't question your good faith, but do you know what a discussion is? We have to understand what the other is saying if we want to debate them. He used "gay", which is an unrelated word, to mean "dumb". One can only come to that conclusion after asking for clarification
The thing with loss of lifespan is that it is always a "a population who does this will live 20 years less than normal", so Luffy can still live 200 years and be an outlier
As I said, those conversations about lifespan are always about "if 200 people did this, the average age of death of that group will be X years less than of 200 people who do not do this". There's never a way to predict an individual's lifespan, unless you're Hawkins or Shyarly
we only see 1 moon, the scientific method tells us to accept that until new evidence falsifies the observations

> Then what kind of haki do you think Oden cut Kaido with <@!415999229564157955> ? <@!191063132053962753> Haki

> because that has been pushed as the only way to hurt kaido , luffy couldn't even scratch him in g4 <@!328936254978916352> The only way Luffy can hurt Kaido, though
Something like inherited haki seems more likely than the advanced haki we've seen so far
> ACoA doesn't just apply to going around defenses it allows you to cause more destruction overall <@!191063132053962753> Source
There's no current reason to assume the haki used as anything to do with the advanced techniques we've seen. It could be regular haki with some passion, inherited haki, or even a new form of advanced. In no way we can be sure
> Luffy could not break a CD collar without it, but he can crush one like a tin can with ACoA <@!191063132053962753> He destroys it from within, there's no mention he does more damage iirc, that's why I asked for a source
> I think this Inherited Haki shit is BS, Kaido was most likely just saying that the scabbards used the same Haki Technique as Oden, Not that its literally Odens Haki <@!269999048046411776> Yeah, could be. The many possibilities is why I say people saying they were using ACoA are making claims they can't defend
> <@!415999229564157955> exactly what do you think ACoA does? <@!191063132053962753> From what we've seen, it allows mission of haki to the air and internal destruction of enemies and objects
> <@!415999229564157955> No really defense for it but I do think its the most Viable option from what we know <@!269999048046411776> It's as viable as any other plausible alternative, inherited haki included
> How the hell does that not function as a damage increase to you then <@!415999229564157955> ? <@!191063132053962753> What we see it difference in location of haki (in the air, past someone's skin, etc.), not damage of haki itself. Again, source it.
> <@!415999229564157955> Ryou is literally every form of CoA including the ACoA. None of luffys strongest attacks coated in normal Armanent Haki were doing anything to Kaido. It was hinted at many times in Udon that the advanced form is needed to actually hurt Kaido. <@!352120879439675392> It just means that Luffy needs to attack beyond Kaido's skin, not that blades need to do the same
> You think that all internal destruction does is allow someone to hurt a character who's skin is too tough to get past with normal force, and nothing else? <@!415999229564157955> <@!191063132053962753> Luffy wanted to do damage beyond the skin because he couldn't pass through it, yes. If you have a source for it making more damage, you can show it
> Rayleigh removing the collar from camie was adv armament right ? Just like luffy removing Yamato’s cuffs. So adv armament does damage from the inside that’s how luffy and the scabbards can hurt kaido <@!564773067969265674> The thing is, the scabbards pierce Kaido, they don't do internal damage, or not *just* internal damage, as what we see is superficial damage
> I'm trying to understand why being able to bypass defenses doesn't count as a buff to the amount to damage someone is able to deal even if their attack doesn't technically have any more force behind it <@!191063132053962753> The thing is, the scabbards actually cut the skin. They aren't damaging (just) the inside, like Luffy is trying to do.
> Have you never played an RPG before? <@!415999229564157955> ? <@!191063132053962753> irrelevant
Ryuo means haki, pls use Advanced CoA or ACoA so we can all understand the discussion
If they used it in a single spot I can see it going through. That's obviously a possibility
> But we can see it's the same as what Hyou does, and seemingly what the scabbards do <@!372464153480134666> Can we *see* it though
> with a sword the damage will be internal anyway <:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045> <@!495255829369454612> But also superficial. Therefore what the scabbards used is different from what Luffy is trying to do
It's like WB vs Roger
But there's no indication that's what the scabbards did, is there?
Maybe this will be explained, maybe it will be left as is
> The part where the back of the tree is blown up is different than what Hyou does <@!372464153480134666> Yeah, some people here are not seeing that, as far as I understand
There was one dude here who couldn't see how what Luffy was doing was different from what the scabbards did

<:NamiFlush:625741106193367054>
Cool outfits are cool outfits bro
<:NamiFlush:625741106193367054>
It's not cosplay
It's a lifestyle
I'll make an X mark tattoo this year or the next
> Stoopid = Okama confirmed? <@!407999944675295265> Why can't I just be a girl tho? What is the evidence?
> stoopid transcends your meaningless conversation of gender <:ShanksYes:727411684095819856> - yes
LOL

<:RobinSmug:485147535875244032>
> Its all downhill from here This aint it chief
oNE pIECE Is dEAD
Yeah can't Luffy just grow?
No character development
> I messed it up <@!521427565492305931> I like moths tho
No need for spoiler tags bro
Orochi is as dead as my party nights before the lockdown
So real dead
imagine having a command
Sanji is dum
> Why is the head of the merry brown in the colored manga? <@!162731766799532032> The paint isn't cheap
> haki can be inherited!!!!!!!!!! <@!280070473667051530> We don't know if it's metaphorical yet
It can be a metaphor because they could be using the same technique Oden used and not actually his haki
It is a methapor. Oden says his soul will live on and Kaido asks himself if they're using Oden's haki. Those could all be metaphorical
Red leg was due to the blood
right below the google definition lol
a thing regarded as representative or symbolic of something else.
A symbol can be metaphorical. "A cold heart" is a symbol of not caring about others' suffering; saying someone has a cold heart is being metaphorical.
> do yall think they will get new epihets after this? <@!280070473667051530> I wouldn't mind a Weather Witch Nami
> like dragin killer zoro or some shit <@!280070473667051530> Zoro aint killing no dragon
Monet should've learned about life and gone with the SH
Show some mercy, Bahamas. Cute girls deserve it
Then why are they cute?
> <@!289876647354826752> At this point I'm fine whoever joins as long as it's not Carrot <@!655999751787118602> Carrot is already a SH
Reread
You're reading the wrong manga
Enel is dead, those were his dreams before dying of suffocation. The brains plays tricks like those
"from North Blue"
Man Monet would really be a good addition
I'm being honest
If Viola joined, Sanji would have a harder time in WCI
> and the SHs have almost no recon powers <@!598085666538258432> Robin
