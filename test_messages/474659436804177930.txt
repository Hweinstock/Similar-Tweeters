I got the big ol mute last night
it was fun
||Fucking Tendo is just making chocolate in Paris. I was honestly not that surprised|| Haikyuu manga ending
I wasn't spoiled at all
And I'm glad
Berserk
Wait smile
I'm on chapter 100 or so
Istg if you overtake me tonight
LMAO
wait King, where are you in
like which part
I see
||Is S4 pt 2 just gonna be the Inarizaki match similar to S3|| Haikyuu S4 pt 2 DONT OPEN KING
oh nice
I gave it a 10, and I gave OP a 10
so they're both amazing
yeh Hog, that's what I was thinking
no I gave the Haikyuu manga a 10
The problem with that lol, is that S4 was still amazing, we're just comparing it to the previous 3 seasons which were all near perfect
lol
OST was shit compared to the previous 3 seasons imo
||I can't believe Tanaka and Shimizu are married. I mean, I guess it makes sense.|| Haikyuu manga ending. Don't open King
Good point
<:AkainuSweat:586408945137090571>
I'm actually doing really well with avoiding spoilers for certain series
Like I knew absolutely zero Haikyuu spoilers
Don't know any Berserk spoilers
feelin good
where are you reading it smile?
you should really download the MEGA link that's pinned here
read it King
it's amazing
you should really consider downloading the link that's pinned here
Archer's my go to source if I have a Berserk question lol
I mean he runs the discord
Actually, knowing him, he'll just say "yes, I like it"
LMAO
yes
very good
I'm not even finished lol
361
first 16 or so are 50 pages long, so I guess you could count them as 2
yeh, most are 20 pages
yeh
AoT is monthly so its longer
it legit took me 20 minutes to read the letter chapters
you're being interrogated
Is Re:Zero worth watching?
Gust?
neither
lol
Guts
I only ask about Re: Zero coz I keep seeing this damn blue haired girl in a maid outfit everywhere I look
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
yeh her
I would really slow down with Berserk
there are some spreads that you can't just gloss over imo
yeh
imo at least
yeh
yhe Miura
Miura's combat style is also better imo
the way he draws fight scenes
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
Lol, Miura is a far more proficient combatant than Murata
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
Berserk sucks hard Will
I agree that Murata's art feels more "robotic"
that's a good point
OPM chapter 58, ||this spread is objectively amazing, but there's something about Miura's spreads that I just find more impactful||
I've rewatched S1 so many times its insane
so rewatchable
OPM s1 is actually hilarious
> opm season 1 is very not hilarious <@!496362640688283649> that's coz your sense of humor is restricted to Buggy D Clown jokes
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
is this S1 Rob?
I wouldn't ask people powerscaling questions on here. It's purely subjective. The only people who have the answers are Oda and myself <@!731646434658615316>
I prefer Saitama to Mob in almost every way, but I understand people preferring Mob
I choose to ignore titles in OP, coz it leads it just leads to confusion and overanalyzing
<#522036834310815744>
I mean Choc, can Zoro truly call himself the worlds greatest swordsman if he doesn't beat everyone who has ever picked up a sword??
So am I
lol
I've come to understand Choc's humor very well dw Wow
damn
idk why, I just never got hooked on Mob as much as a lot of people die
still really enjoy it
Buggy isn't annoying, Buggy jokes are annoying
are you still reading on mobile?
omg ur going too fast smile those chapters took me 20 minutes each to read I know I can't speak for everyone but hot damn
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
how many chapters is slam dunk?
ok, so not as long as Haikyuu
what are you rating it Mai?
outta 10
that's how I feel about Haikyuu atm
but I don't think I'm gonna change it
I'm gonna read AnJ before Slam Dunk tho
I'm assuming it's high school basketball right?
||were they like Ennoshita, Kinoshita, and Karita levels of irrelevancy <:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045> ? || Haikyuu and Slam Dunk
damn
you prefer SD to Haikyuu Juba?
how can someone's opinion on a fictional series be disrespectful?
7 is still good
for me
I would only give 10s to things I consider practically flawless
I only have two 10s so far
granted my list is smaller than most
but still
yeh Cho, I see you only have two 10s as well
oh right, I was looking at ur manga list
oh shit, I didn't scroll down enough
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
(ghost stories)
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
I would be really concerned if it wasn't lol
<:NICEFUCKINSHIT:605709924395122720>
this is my note for haikyuu on anilist lol
I can totally see that Mai
I pretty much rely on some of the people on here's recommendations lmao
is chihayafaru still ongoing?
||Like for instance, you could say, Griffith decided to become Femto due to his childhood ambition/dream, coupled with the trauma he faced during his torture. But did the IoE manipulate cause and effect to where Griffith had sex with Charlotte, was found out, then tortured. Like, were those events destined to happen so that things would eventually lead to Griffith making the choice during the eclipse? Is everything not 100% certain to happen, or are some things certain so that it can lead to eventual "choices". I'm just kinda confused on how much actual free will people have in Berserk.|| Berserk 94
Ooh Ok, that makes a lot more sense
thanks for being patient with my retardation Archer
really appreciate it
some people on the other server have told me they prefer conviction to golden age
so I'm just really in the Berserk "mode" rn
||but there are like mini "sub-arcs" in the grand scheme of the conviction arc right? Like I'm on the lost children "sub-arc"|| Berserk Conviction arc
yeh, that makes sense
smile omg, ur legit gonna overtake me in the space of a couple of hours
yeh, that's what I figured
oh ok
hmmmm
interesting
ngl, Berserk memes are funny af
or edgy I guess
but still funny
I hate that a few have made me laugh, even tho I know they're mostly sick
yes
||I hate the Donovan memes||
but there are others that I've seen on different subjects
that have made me laugh
yep
I find the idol master memes kinda funny
||is that why berserklejerk exists?||
for all the degenerates
wdym, on this server, or other channels
it is kinda weird how thats the thing that is most memed about
||Donovan||
wait smile
is that ch 30 after the letter chapters???!!!
or episode
rather
WTF??
||lol, I love how you guys have a role for people who correctly guess when a chapter will drop|| Archer
and you ofc have it
you genius
||Also, I'm pretty sure skull knight mentioned this. But that "child" Casca gave birth to, that's Guts' not Griffith's right?|| Berserk 94
<:WapolTriggered:587621943725916180>
blasphemy
I see
||was kinda pissed when Casca lost her memories, but I'm sure it will work out as read further|| Berserk 94 don't open smile
ok I have to keep reading, smile I think you will actually overtake me
ippo and jojos
lol
Good
Lmao Cho
I'm so mixed on whether I should actually read Jojo
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
I'm like halfway through part 2
but I watch maybe 1 episode a week lol
um ... it's better than part 1 definitely
I'm enjoying it
but it's not amazing
yeh I like Joseph
it's more if I'm willing to commit to it before/over other series I want to watch
and read
oh, no doubt in my mind I will prefer Berserk over Jojos lol
I'm loving Gintama as well
I've watch probably 40 episodes over the course of 2 years
but I really like it
when you're practically an anime/manga virgin
life's tough
Archer can I tell you something
I watched all of the 97 adaptation in dub on youtube the other day
and started watching 2016
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
dw I stopped
||she's reading in the time chamber from dragon ball|| db
||who's being tortured?|| Berserk 38 smile
HOW ARE YOU READING THIS FAST ON MOBILE???????
what is going on
||isn't that later?|| Berserk
yeh that's not right
wait
really?
||wait so he's already burned the queen in the tower?|| Berserk 38 I guess
I'm convinced you have super powers smile
<:WapolTriggered:587621943725916180>
what season??
my favorite
enjoy
<:ok_Griff:452942412579471411>
very nice
||I prefer her way over whoever plays Britta can't remember her name|| Archer
but that's western series so I'll drop it
I finished this morning Shimon
<:ZeusShit:396351094483058689>
ummmmmm
I think I'll still say one piece
but I gave haikyuu a 10
so
YAY
me and Shimon
the funny thing is
Shimon asked to be muted
Red just muted me
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
nooo, when he caught me in general, I was literally back from getting a snack from the fridge, then I just wanted to say hi
but nope
<:UsoppBan:639600917070610442>
nah it was funny
all good
and to be absolutely fair to Red
I most likely would not have finished if he didn't mute me
LOL
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
maybe I need to do that with every series I read
just mute me the whole time til I finish
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
mute me til I finish every series ever
not if I don't read the series coz I keep getting distracted
lol
I have the attention span of a mongoose
||oooh just realized this is the bitch who was there when skull knight saved rickert that one time|| Berserk 100
yeh
||I was just saying this on the berserk server, I only just realized as well that it was the count who "killed" Pippin, but I did realize that the succubus || Berserk 100
Haikyuu manga ending||I kinda knew they were going to lose. But the way it was executed was perfect. Me and Mai were talking earlier, but Takeda's speech to Hinata was so powerful. Perfect end to the tournament arc. Kenma giving Shoyo the iPad was so awesome. I'm glad they are such great friends even though they are completely opposite personalities. The Brazil stuff was great, loved seeing Oikawa, but I think the Jackals vs Adlers match was pretty much a flawless ending. Everything about it was just amazing. I too had that "theory" that the second manga the little wants to start is "Haikyuu", probably not but would be cool. All the characters had a super satisfying, believable, and fitting ending and practically all their arcs came full circle. Furudate is actually one of the best character writers I've read in manga so far, and that's not even including how well they write the actual volleyball aspect of the story. This manga is an easy 10/10. I'm already thinking of rewatching/rereading soon.||
||oh yeah, and him telling Hoshiumi he can be the little giant coz he decided the greatest decoy was better for him was easily a top 10 moment for me in the series|| Haikyuu manga ending
> haikyuu manga ending spoilers ||I'm sure 99.99% of people didn't expect the timeskip. Glad you loved it all though, some people are really offput by it|| <@!377670308280139784> Really???
I loved every second of it
I thought it was practically flawless
<:NICEFUCKINSHIT:605709924395122720>
||did they want to see another year at Karasuno, without Daichi, Suga, and Asahi? I'm glad that didn't happen, and I think the way the tournament ended for them was perfect|| Haikyuu 402
me too
||I'm also glad that the team that won the tournament was a team I don't think we ever heard of or seen any players from. It made the idea that the tournament was the be all end all. The national team coach said it best where there is always gonna be a team better than you, and it's impossible to win them all. Karasuno didn't have to win to prove that they were a top team in the nation, nor did they have to win for Shoyo, Kageyama, and Tsukki to all become pros.|| haikyuu 402
||| I  think that's kinda stupid ngl. What did they expect? Another 800 chapters? with each interval losing core members of the cast. I'm so glad we got what we got.|| Haikyuu 402 mai
||maybe a mini arc or something showing his 2nd and 3rd years, but even that I think isn't really needed?|| Haikyuu 402
||this may just be recency bias and I need more time to absorb, but I think the ending was perfect|| Haikyuu 402
I'm really surprised by that ngl
||I just found the transition to the ts super refreshing. In a battle shonen or something, you know the good guys are gonna win and save the world or w/e. But here, I found the ending of the tournament fulfilling. I enjoyed Haikyuu for the characters more than anything. What would showing Hinata's other years which would probably be very similar do? And it's not like the content of the ts was disappointing. It was perfect and felt earned. idk that's just my take|| Haikyuu 402
||I would go off on that argument. Imo, that's really idiotic and trust me, in hindsight, if they got that, they'd probably end up complaining that Haikyuu "isn't what it used to be" or is getting "too repetitive".|| Haikyuu 402 mai
||I'm actually really surprised by that, so were some people genuinely "upset" by the ending. Or dissatisfied? I mean to each their own I just find that really surprising|| Haikyuu 402
||Or I guess I mean the ts in general|| ^
I still haven't read the latest OP chapter lol
scans
do you wait for official?
I wonder why Doen hmmmm
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
||I guess that's sorta fair. I guess if there is a precedent or expectation set by other sports manga then I can see why some were offput by the idea of a ts. But imo, I would find it very surprising if after reading what Furudate produced in the ts, that people would still dislike/criticize it. Your irl friend, I can totally understand.|| Haikyuu 402 mai
||but did you dislike the actual content of the ts Adam or just the idea that there was one rather than showing the remaining Karasuno years?|| haikyuu 402
||I disagree with that Adam, but I can see where you're coming from. I just think that in 5 years down the line, we got year 2 and it was similar content to year 1, people would complain that it was becoming repetitive and stagnant.|| Haikyuu 402
||I very much doubt people would end up liking/accepting new first year characters in replace of the third years. It happens way too often in fiction. People just don't like change from the norm especially when they expect a certain precedent. If new first years joined, I'm assuming Hinata/Kageyama/Tsukki would still be the main focus, and we'd end up just replacing already loved and established characters with newbies who people won't care about. And the volleyball content would be similar.|| Haikyuu 402
||I also don't think Haikyuu would suit being a 1000+ chapter series. Idk much about Ippo, but I hear a lot of people complain about it's "unnecessary length". I really wouldn't want the main Haikyuu story just copied and pasted two more times for the sake of seeing Hinata "grow". I just feel like Furudate made a very clever decision and for me at least, did not sacrifice any enjoyment. Most likely increased it ngl|| Haikyuu 402
Haikyuu 402, ||and we were told the outcome of the 2nd and 3rd years at nationals. It would be very similar stuff with Hinata and Kageyama getting better each year. I don't know what more developments on the volleyball side of things people were expecting. I'm very confident that a 2nd and 3rd year would just be very similar to year 1 whilst losing more and more of the main cast we spent 400 chapters loving.||
||The funny thing is, I wasn't at all surprised by the implementation of the ts. I wasn't for a second like "oh I was expecting this, lets see where this goes". I instantly believed that this was the right path Furudate could have taken. Just enjoyed this shit outa of it|| Haikyuu 402
yeh its a webtoon
my bad
||I just felt that first year alone was so thrilling a story that it works perfectly on its own. To me, that's the story of Haikyuu. I was left feeling like something was still missing. || Haikyuu 402
||I have to disagree Adam. The potential for more and more story telling is there in One Piece because the way Oda has structured it. One Piece could not end rn and feel like a complete story. There's still so much left missing. Whereas imo, the beginning of Haikyuu to the end of nationals felt like it's own, fully fleshed out story that could easily work on its own. And quite frankly did. The ts was just the cherry on top. I just didn't see the need for longevity in a series like Haikyuu where I feel like what story needed to be told, had already been told, and that fans just wanted more Haikyuu, without realizing that it would most likely just be more of the same.|| Haikyuu 402
||Red is Kenma confirmed|| Haikyuu 402
well I really enjoyed that discussion
<:PES_TuxedoToast:585724570082738178>
||when your argument isn't good enough to be featured in Adam's rebuttle||
<:CryBoy:585546888175157258>
jk
Mai just summed it up
||Obviously their growth as people isn't finished at the age of 16. They haven't discovered their purpose through a volleyball game. But the moments of development we saw from each character were relevant for the story of Haikyuu. It's a story about volleyball. It's also a story about character growth. How do you combine the two? Tanaka is a perfect example. He was right, he really was just an average, surface level guy, but he learned how that can still be useful and why it's not necessarily a bad thing through a game of volleyball, within the confines of the story. As Mai said, there's just no way Furudate could show us every single piece of development and lesson these characters learn whilst also showing them through meaningful moments such as Tsukki's block. For what we got, it's completely reasonable and realistic the way Furudate developed these characters.|| Haikyuu 402
||but they didn't fix or sort out their entire lives. Furudate gave us some key flaws with each character, and they eventually learned a lesson through volleyball. They didn't become enlightened or anything. It's just an interesting way to develop characters through a sport without it being super life changing or awakening.|| Haikyuu 402
||I don't really understand his argument tho. Is he saying it's impossible for people to find themselves in the context of a year of highschool? || Haikyuu 402
bday?
oh ok
fuck youuuuu
<:LUL:321931602655707136>

aight thanks
legit thought you linked me some furry fanfic Choc <:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
||I wouldn't really accuse him of being a copout. But I do think there isn't much of a substantial argument for a 2nd and 3rd year, and most fans probably just wanted more Haikyuu, whereas I thought the ending was perfect as it was|| Haikyuu 402
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
ok, Adam you gotta come back and say something
where'd you go?

<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
All day every day
Just assume I’m lying
Tends to be everyone else’s strategy
You want my opinion
One piece is by far more important than anything you have done, are doing, or will ever do. So with that being said. You should probably get some sleep
Same
I hate it
I HATE IT
Yeh but you’re probably in a competent country where Corona isn’t as bad
Whereas we’re in this cesspool
Yes! I always wanted to call you Shim but didn’t know if you’d like it
So now I can finally call you SHIM
Shortened names are always the way to go
Ewwww
Being such a bad student you completely forgot you had AP psych homework <:viviPanic:738523407808856145>
This was a couple of years ago, what’s done is done
<:MoriaFeels:544294371512811521>
Imagine even featuring on it
<:Uso:637751966184767546>
Youss knows the feeling
I remember when I first started I literally only used <#164971940648321024>
Now I avoid it as much as possible
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
Very true Shim
Also now that we’re so big, you just get a swarm of white names in there which isn’t a bad thing, but I can’t even get a word in
So
Yeh, you get this white name who asks a very lewd and uncomfortable question
Then I yeet

||you don't like Griffith? Like as a villain?|| Berserk 94+
I know how to make a lotta people on here mad, real quick
he opened them?????
gdi
you silly silly man
I'm good at not opening stuff
yeh Laww, definitely not to simp <:LuffyTruthful:671944878569160714>
Tendou is better than Kuroo imo
^
really?
I have 2
I said that to him recently as well lol
I understand Stranger as well now
||1. Tsukki 2. Oikawa 3. Atsumu 4. Kageyama 5. Bokuto 6. Hinata||
||0. Shimizu 😉  1. Tsukki 2. Oikawa 3. Atsumu 4. Kageyama 5. Bokuto 6. Hinata 7. Nishi 8. Kenma 9. Ushi 10. Ukai||
||Bokuto reminds me of Mirio from MHA|| Haikyuu and MHA
I'm like the only one with Kageyama in my top 5
they do, he's a mixture. ||Bokuto has can be darker and more intense, but they both have that seemingly never-ending enthusiasm that is almost contagious. But he's definitely a mix of other characters. But I get some Mirio vibes from him|| Haikyuu 402 mai
oh sorry Cho
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
notice me
notice me!!!!!!!!!!!!
is he not?
I thought i had him on there
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
<:LuffyTruthful:671944878569160714>
nahhhh
haikyuu manga  ||1. Inarizaki 2. Shiratorizawa 3. Final Game 4. Nekoma 5. Aobajohsai 2||
it will
trust
||its the best game|| haikyuu manga
I love ringo
Haikyuu manga||I still felt tense as fuck reading that game even tho I was like 95% certain they'd win||
best girl Toko
Haikyuu manga ||maybe my predictions were just too good, coz I had guessed they'd beat Inarizaki and Nekoma, but I knew they would lose against Kamomedai||
I tend to looks at Mai's anilist anyway when I want recs
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
I love Toko's VA
forgot they used Dogstorm and Catviper <:Crydo:586275183032270849>
can't be Bean
stop lying
||the only reason the results mattered were so we could get more matches Mai <:LULW:607641487429206106> || Haikyuu manga
the power of the Rayleigh flashback is strong today
why is it only Luffy and Zoro mid episode things
Mai, Haikyuu manga,|| did you prefer Hinata and Kageyama's block against Inarizaki, or Hinata's spike vs Shiratorizawa?||
true
me too
I love Tendou v
very cool
thanks Jeff
Much love
<:BokutoPeace:711792459226808508>
Fine, I'll use my true favorite character as a pfp
that's not why
I made mine coz bubs changed hers to Tendou
so I wanted to one up her
I'm still cringe don't you worr
can someone give me back my spade pirates role
I hate this color
and the civilians role
I know but it still says I have it, but because Moe manually changed it, it doesn't show up
what about now
THERE WE GO
nvm
idk
oh god
don't snitch
<:LuffyTruthful:671944878569160714>
Mai didn't you say ur changing soon?
not cultured, just horny
lol
"spreading the word"
is it free?
Mai is a waifu tbf
because it's him irl
Idk what pfp to use
I'm just gonna go back to a default discord pfp
make people not know who I am
tag what series that's from
please
I'm kinda bored of my normal pfp
yeh maybe I'll just use a Berserk pfp
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
join the marines
<:CobySalute:638916402467569675>

Sidra is ur pfp Momo?
I guess not
lol
she's from MHA
<@!510934064610541580> can you put the series ur talkin about before the tag please, I'm not caught up with AoT <:LuffyWave:356709589670035456>
oh no problem
speaking of the giants, I once met Tim Lincecum
for like 2 seconds lol
sucks to be a giants fan atm
dem racoons be arsonist
1???
1 is number 1
isn't that just a mashup of all the other openings?
Mai is back to Mai
I'm not anime only, but I'm not up to date and to be honest, I've completely forgotten what happens
lol
yeh I think I remember that Shim
but that's about it
he thinks he's watching me
when actually
I'm the one watching him
https://youtu.be/E6T8SksLtXg?t=191 this is my favorite OST from AoT
at the timestamp
<a:aPES_TripleEyes:688793967751725135>
those were the Tim Lincegoat days
what's the score btw
> You were considered youss <@!380840459641159683> WAS I???????
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
jk
people think DFs spawn to the nearest fruit coz of the smiley incident
but that's never been confirmed
LMAO fleeb
what kinda question is that?
If I were in one piece I'd be yonko coz I clearly have that kinda power and influence in the real world
<:CrocoKidEvenMoreDistorted:586469633419378704>
I don't what ur talking about
you wanna know the character I could theoretically be right now?
the fucking marine who Akainu murders for fleeing
that would be me
anyone else would be pulling stuff outta my ass
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
4 HOURS STRAIGHT WTF
> Don't worry Evan, just face it. Between you and me, we all know I fit the bill better for the user on the sidelines grabbing popcorn 🍿 <@!165877926498140161> LMAO
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
If the mods ever make a meme and need regulars, I'd be the fodder character that gets killed to the side of the panel
nah, coz even that dude got lines
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
I'd be some lineless fodder who is only halfway in the panel
um, 110 I think
I really need to pick up the pace
do you think there's even a chance of Luffy's mom never being revealed?
I think so too
good joke
who, Dragon?
oh
for a second Choc, I thought you had a stroke, but then realized you were saying Don Quixote Homing
nah
show me
I want to see <:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>

Idk, I don't see it happening, I don't see how it would work
my dad watches ice road truckers and moonshiners
hasn't quite made it to anime yet
I think so too
The not eating I think is probably from photosynthesis due to his fruit
TECHNICALLY. There is an argument for it being any of the 3 which is really cool
but yeh I think paramecia is the most likely
I wish I had your dads
My mom makes fun of me for "looking like one of those anime characters"
> JSG=Just Super Great <@!216582410756685824> <:BepoBlush:544527768583667747> ur making me blush
you just quoted urself <:LULW:607641487429206106>

<:LULW:607641487429206106>
!rank
really? I respect guys with long hair
mine isn't long at the back tho, just looks like a mess
it's said that wood from the treasure tree adam is the most durable wood in the world. I think franky told a story about how there were constant wars on this one island but the adam trees were never destroyed

<:LULW:607641487429206106>
but that blue is a nice color
yeh, I'd only be this orange or that blue

so, you'd be seeing me from like 4 years ago
wait so ur picture will be from 3 years ago as well?
I'm big chad <:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
yeh true
i don't really mind
let's do it
k lemme find a decent picture first <:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
OH GOD HAHAHAHAHA
I have so many cringey shirtless pictures during my teen "gym" phase where I worked out like crazy
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
God I was cringe
not anymore
sadly
I'm still looking for one that isn't super cringey
gimme a sec
nah I look like a mess rn
NO
I am not
OMG I can't find a non-cringey one but I guess this will have to do
k Viri, I'm ready if you are
v cute
for sure
yeh it can't be
ooooooh
I'm bored
I wanna play something
I'm waiting for ur's I'm ready
Ok but keep in mind this is from 2016
Orange
Ok
Black <:Emoji:612670056161214508>
Full emo
That’s the best option
Very much so
Pasta irl

that's probably the only way to become actually fluent
gotta speak with native speakers
or people who are already fluent
in normal conversations
ok, I'll get mine ready
yeh mine's from 2016
ok, context first. My friend wanted to do some weird filter thing with people's faces, so I just sent him a very bland photo
WE'RE FRATERNAL
ok 2016, very bland me coming up

fuck it
that's me four years ago
<:BrookShrug:680559335058702376>
yep, I have a baby face
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
that's coz I am younger than you lmao
K VIRI NOW UR TURN <:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
I am part spanish technically
nawwwww
k I hardly take selfies, and the very few I have of current me, I look homesless
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
coz my friend asked for a very still picture
he wanted to do these weird edit filter things
never Moe
I already know what Pasta looks like
<:MoriaFeels:544294371512811521>
and Doom
no way you've seen Doom
of current us?
oh man, gotta take a decent picture first <:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
out of the mods ... lets see
I've seen Moe, Bean, Jeff, and I think that's it
lurkers <a:aPES_Spit:688793967747530842>
😷
big sad
just study the book of the One Piece
yeh no wonder power scalers are so stupid Pasta
they took ur class
I moved straight onto advanced powerscaling
only for the elite
I taught Pasta everything he knows
none of you would pass my class
it takes a very high capacity for learning to pass
don't need to know how to read, if you are the book itself
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
imagine a class called "evan won't be a mod 101" <:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
I am Doom's apprentice
I already am
yes, I'm his padawan
I'm useless with technology as well Sab
<a:aPES_CryDrown:644479445637529620>
do it
yes and I'm yours

I've grown I promise!!!!
what the hell

it's funny, my mom said the same thing the other day
<:PES_CryTeddy:643089269614968851>
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
i would ping all the mods asking if I could be their apprentice, but they'd just get mad lmao
Red is the LAST person who'd take me on as apprentice
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
hell nah, I'm not that brave
the funny thing is
me and Archer agree on almost everything
it's weird
I think he's copying me
ur cringe
I have my application ready

I think the answer really inhabited my ambition and talents
ofc lmao
at least I hope it is
NO BUBS
get it away
<a:runningemote:735442727239417917>
btw guys. I didn't get to 10 hours last night
of listening to the Guts theme
I want an example of a good regular
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
Youss
I tell people where to get a role, or to spoiler tag their stuff. Or to stop being annoying if they're spamming. But that's only because I'm genuinely annoyed and want them to stop
kinda
that's coz I took like a 5 month break lol
yeppers
oh come on
I joined December last year
but didn't speak for like 5 months, because I didn't know how to post images
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
idk
I remember the first person I talked to was YC
who is?
BUBS????!!!
very clearly
yeh I didn't start talking til this year
that's coz Apoo is the worst character in the series
so I am the worst member of the server <:Crydo:586275183032270849>
ugggggh I'm bored as hell

<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
one day maybe
I don't upload anything lol
that would probably be my name lol
I can play a few instruments
none to a high level tho
maybe except piano, but that's not even that high level
I have played piano, guitar, violin, and french horn
kinda a wide range lmao
I can only play piano, and a little bit of guitar still
I had to quit french horn
hurt my mouth <:LULW:607641487429206106>
yep Sab
I also have asthmas
so not a good idea for me
I also hate the taste of metal
when I first started learning
I had to share a mouthpiece with 3 other dudes
that was nasty
<a:GutsMegaCry:721314623495733288>

it's not fair
I thought I told you this before no?
humans are disgusting creatures
I want lasers
mine was a cougar
this is gonna sound like a dumb question

or clean them
really?
interesting

really?
wapol
I don’t think it’s a lie
I think it’s genuinely a big battleship
Uranus idk
Could be anything
That’s actually interesting
Coz when you think about it
It’s taken them centuries to build a bridge that isn’t even finished
So how did the red line get made so quickly?
Interesting
It is
I dunno about the red line, but I think Continent pullers pulled many islands together to form Wano. Hence all the different climates
dude, the lord of the coast is much smaller than the ones we saw at FMI

<a:aPES_Laugh:664885767574781964>
Sounds nice
I’m gonna be riding horses everyday for a week. I’m kinda nervous
Did you see Pasta’s meme then?
I’ve never ridden a horse
Oh nice
I live in NC so it’s like a 2 hour drive
How was it?
I just gotta remember to never stand behind one
Coz they kick
Sometimes
It’s soooo cheap
Yeh Viri <:PES_ReeCowboy:585724569617170432>
There’s no WiFi and barely any signal

How many chapters are there in conviction?
As in Berserk chapters
Yes
Flabbergast
Shouldn’t be a word
I hate the word, precipitation. Makes me cringe for some reason
Ah Viri, life wouldn’t be the same without your hilarious typos
<:pepelaugh:601460290457960500>
Oh nice
||I thought Rosine was actually a really nice villain. The apostles I’ve seen to this point, mainly sacrificed for more power or in Wyalds case, sex lol. But I actually felt sympathy for Rosine. Miura did a nice job with the whole innocent child in a fairy tale trope, for instance with the legend of Peekaf. This chapter just had a really nice fantasy vibe to it, with obviously a lot of Guts ripping people in half lol|| Berserk 117
Huh
Coz they’re white names
Kill it!!!
Murder it
Butcher it
SEND IT TO HELL
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
Eat it then
Kill
Kill
Kill
And his hat is stupid
Bring back the old one

Yoooo I just thought of the best comparison to me for this server
I’m like Dwight from the office
my jokes are very original
I'm a very funny person
very funny
will do
I'm really tired so I might go back to sleep
Favorite character
||I’ve been thinking for a bit, but yeh, I think I prefer him to Guts. But not by much|| Berserk
Jinbe’s vagabond drill was fucking fire so let’s count him <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Where did he show it?
Why tf would he. So stupid to think he had it before Mihawks training
Ryuo is just Wanos term for armament haki
No he wasn’t
> "six king pistol" for the six clans of wano @aleksandr.hashimikov#7872  <:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
Nerd
They’re martial arts techniques specifically designed for assassination like tasks. Nothing to do with will as Pasta said
Most likely, the master swordsmen use it on their swords
Actually ... most definitely
I don’t understand your logic
Stop making connections that just aren’t there to fit your headcanon
No they don’t
I thought it just said Lucci
Pre ts
WHAT????
> imo cp9 might have been trained in wano @aleksandr.hashimikov#7872  this is easily debunkable
Cp9 are government trained assassins. Wano is independent of the WG’s domain. Why tf would they be trained on Wano, we already where they were trained
<:LUL:321931602655707136> <:LUL:321931602655707136> <:LUL:321931602655707136>

<:CrocoDurr:663850964763279381>
People. Just assume, the nothing we saw during Enies Lobby, was haki
When did it come out?
Zyph do u have a switch ?
Do u have MK?
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>

I’m. Free
Yeh some douchebag manga reader would just go into anime theories and say manga stuff as if he doesn’t know
For chad points
The admin
You guy you pinged is Red
What does that mean
<@380840459641159683> good ol Rigatoni
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
What kinda food?
One of my favorites
But this lack of service should not be tolerated
I might have to intervene
is it kbbq?
you should tell them you're a member of the r/onepiece discord server
they'd obey your every whim
idk about other states. But literally no restaurants have opened back up in my area
so it's been home food or chick fila mostly lol
15 lbs?
my pleasure
Strong, start running
but then like
don't stop running
send pics if you can
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
but that will bring you to 600 lbs
isn't that a bit much?
👀
oh so you'll be a THICC boi
I see
1200, is honestly the max I can see it
I don't even think over 1200
I think Oda is genuine about the 5 years thing
we get 38 chapters on average, this year even less by the looks of it
so no
I don't think we're reaching over 1200
certainly not 1300
doubt it
you can
thriller bark was 48 chapters
amazon lily was like 11
sabaody was about 24 iirc
impel down was 25
mf 30
I have too much free time
realistically. we're at the 78 chapter mark of wano. I honestly think we only have maybe 40 chapters left (at most). I think the final saga can easily be finished within the 1020-1200 range
180 chapters for a saga is reasonable
we only don't know the location of the 4th
uh oh
I mean ... it was never said that they didn't do that during the fb so....
But I think it makes more sense if it was WB or Shanks
but it's still possible Archer
WB is the sage guess
Why would Roger take the poneglyph tho if he was gonna go straight to Laugh Tale
kinda seems like a nuisance
telling WB about it seems like a safe bet
elbaf <:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
gotta believe
that would be a good idea actually
coz it's such an irrelevant island
who tf would want to go there
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
Elbaf is the safe bet
orrrrr
Loadstar??
maybe
idk
have we always had this?
yeh its really cool
i like it a lot
how old is Kuro?
get gud at one piece Shimon
people's varying sizes in one piece is such an Oda thing to do and I love it
like it's just normal to be 9 feet tall
makes character designs way more interesting
by the looks of it, you seemed to know what you're doing pretty well <:LULW:607641487429206106>
its really good
hello
can I get a "nice" from everyone please
has your food arrived yet fats?
I'm 5'7 but I tell people I'm 6 feet
Archer big chungus
no you need a faction my guy
well if you told people you were 6 feet archer, there wouldn't be any ladies for the rest of us. So I thank you for your sacrifice
I wonder how tall I am?
I'm the BIGGEST boi
pfffffft fleeb
don't even compare
Archer has SPPS
Doom thinks I'm a manlet
screw finding the one piece, I need to find out the mystery of the "girl"
have I been summoned?
why
oh
I am indeed the pinnacle of modern masculinity \
Marc is close
no one is ever "attacked" here, as long as they don't say stupid things
woah, a wild cuck as arrived
oh dw Youss
I'm a big cuck
I don't attack
I protect
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
aren't you two actually considering becoming roomies or was that mainly a meme?
should I read or watch Chihaya
?
no I meant Bean and Sab
but I'm sure you're excellent roommate material
and you like one piece
my criteria is met
👉 👈
basically, I only wanna watch stuff if the adaptation is unanimously better than the manga
so if they're practically even, I'll just read it
I'm sorry ..
8 baskets ..
of marble?
why?
marbles
really?
I thought you both told me to read after s3
I could be wrong
I don't remember
did he now
😡
fuccck I almost clicked that
close call
ngl, this is gonna sound cringe
but I kinda liked having red and mai etc... for my readthrough of Haikyuu. Nice to have people who are already passionate about a series spur you on like that
<:BepoBlush:544527768583667747>
I promise you I'm not gay

he's ok tho
who gave you that nickname? <:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
it fits
I remember these fucking things
oh god
<:NamiFlush:625741106193367054>

yeh
I'm bout to share your fate tho
wait what
yeh people change their actual discord names instead of their server nicknames
<:CrocoKidEvenMoreDistorted:586469633419378704>
||eat it||
that's gotta suck
did you forget you even made it?
incomes another one
yeh, I was convinced he was dead as well
Mine is on orochi being dead
and I'm 90% he is still alive
so I'm fucked
hmmm ... maybe I should use it as a pfp?
<:LuffyThink:701983952482599032>
my bet is with smelly
about whether Orochi actually died
I said yes
but now I don't think it's true
yes
with smelly it's infinite
coz I was so sure
of myself
lemme see if I can find it
k I can't find the actual bet itself, but here's proof it exists. I'm completely fucked
I actually like Yamaguchi
<:Uso:637751966184767546>
is my name actually changed
yep
fuck
not that bad
||Ushijima was a good server, but it wasn't his specialty || Haikyuu manga

yes
I agree
cucky niichan
wtf
I nEvEr KnEw HiS nAmE wAs YoUsS
<:rebki:374759708223078400>
you can call me Evan
I don't mind
you can call me perry the fucking platypus I don't really care
I am beyond names
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
THATS NOT TRUE
no, I changed mine coz Bubs changed hers, so I was like ... "trying to be Red's favorite hmm" so I changed it for like 2 seconds. I wasn't gonna keep it obvs. Tendo isn't even close to my favorite character from Haikyuu
😡
yes
actually
Tsukki
I was contemplating reading Haikyuu before
casual
really?
OH FUCK
I spilt water all over my desk
just wiped it with my shirt
too lazy to get a paper towel
I'm both
literally
I'm half british
yeh, it's a shame
is it any good?
yeh enjoy

is it ongoing?
I'll put it on my list
probably be 5 years by the time I get to it
nani??

I only know Chika from this fucking dance
and my mom thinks I'm a weeb coz she caught me watching it
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
I know that, but I didn't want my parents to think any less of me
now they do
I dunno who that is
oh, I thought he was a former user or something
yep
I have the big gay
ur outta nitro
ur not a booster anymore

we are the elite
idk
I think it was Doom
that's cringe
what a loser
let me check
2 are mine

fuck I'm slow
I need to hurry up
fine
I'll just go give them to BDA
smile is gonna finish Berserk tonight
<:BepoSad:626931310241251360>
nitro boosters have big pp's
no Marc
I just don't have the cognitive capacity to read fast
yes
its honestly a life saver
yeh so I just finished ||Lost children|| Berserk 120
hello there
I don't know how you could read any manga
on ur phone
oh
that's what I do
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
I just have mine like this, then change every volume
am I doing it wrong?
wait red, do you prefer Berserk to One Piece?
who doesn't
are you finished?
so like 15 chapters left
361
smile might have the world record
Is Berserk on there tho
I haven't read enough manga for my list to have and validity
the only things I could confidently have in my top 5 are OP, Haikyuu, Vinland, and thats about it
really?
I have s3 as a 10
the rest are like a 9 I think
do I follow Stranger?
I've watched the first 2 episodes of FMAB probably 5 times. Never got past that point
lmao
s4 is definitely not a 10 for me
<:rebki:374759708223078400>
I've only seen s1 of mob psycho
FUCK
I clicked that <a:GutsMegaCry:721314623495733288>
literally didn't mean to not ur fault
FUCKKLKLD
funny you say that red. Coz I literally have a list called things to read after berserk lmao
yeh definitely
I like the idea of act age a lot
who cares
we have the first seed
but yeh
I'm worried for the playoffs
is that 259 or 359?
not available in my country <:MoriaFeels:544294371512811521>

oh I was joking, is that actually what happens??
just recycled VAs
?
Wow
you're actually caught up
that's impressive
what she can read in an hour, is what i can read in a week <:LULW:607641487429206106>
I'm really slow
I thought you were only on MF?
that can't be true
ur on here too much to have been reading 6-12 hours straight
for Berserk at least
yes, I'm the biggay
HOW DO YOU DO THIS? It's actually impressive
cuts people in half
it's an easy 10
only need 2 days
Miura should make the chapters 40 pages now since they're so infrequent
<:Uso:637751966184767546>
yeh I guess that's true
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
if they were 40 pages we'd only get 1 chapter last year <:CrocoKidEvenMoreDistorted:586469633419378704>
god I'm stupid
how does it feel to be caught up smile
he must be in his 50s now right?
wooh
I need to pick up the pace
I'm going TOO slowly
um... 120 I think
||Binding chains chapter|| Berserk 120
||I think he might be in my top 3 villains of all time now|| Berserk 120+
I haven't
I'm doing good so far
I don't
||do you prefer binding chains to lost children?|| Berserk 120 Archer
read them first
they're the actual first chapters
no
I did that lol
messed up big time
I really enjoyed black swordsman actually
376
ig
but they're longer
tag that
||well it's a female||
wait Shim
you haven't read the letter chapters?
I think Black Swordsman being before Golden Age was a good decision.|| Guts is sooo much darker during Black Swordsman than the beginning of GA. Seeing the transformation was amazing|| Berserk
oh Archer I have another question
||so, you know how Rosine turned the abducted children into little insect "elves", is that similar to how the Count turned Zondark into that monster thing. And does that mean all all apostles can do that? And... are those "minion" technically apostles themselves? surely not coz they didn't have their own beherit and sacrifice to the godhand?|| Berserk Archer
ohhh ok
that makes sense
I see
thanks guys
because Golden Age works well as its own story
||its a prequel/flashback from the first arc|| Berserk
the biggest WTF moment so far would probably be ...
um
||Either king of midland with Charlotte, or Donovan I guess. But that's more of a "damn, this is pretty dark and intense moment". The biggest "holy shit, this is amazing moment" is definitely the entire eclipse. Some of the best fiction I've ever read.|| Berserk
||God just thinking about the eclipse sequence. How do you come up with something like that. It's just so damn good|| Berserk 94
ok, I think this is a good time to go read some more myself
see ya
<:ok_Griff:452942412579471411>
I'll come back on if I finish|| binding chain||
yes sir
blazers are a real threat to the lakers if we have to play them first round
I think they'll make it Juba

the current saga has been from Zou (2015) to now so its only been 5 years
most likely yes
Do you now???? hmmmm
this is the only accurate part of your rank
<:RayleighCringe:707436804911005717>
this is not s tier
Hi Emood <a:aWAHWavingBack:561303247512403980>

fate have you even been to Tommy's?
<@!145193576165408769>
ty ty
why are you so weak Youssef 😦
I mean yeh basically
this meme sums it up best
I look some of the openings she's done sure
don't know much of her other music
I like ADAMAS as well
I think that was for SAO
idk I never watch it
oh wow the hiyori emote has already been made
that was fast
wait is that from another server?
yep it is
ok
its called :hiyorihappy: but it's not from this serber
poor Moria
now he's just a chonky boi
It’s Red
Tch
What’s with this shit quality
Lucky roux is from south
I think Beckman is from north
Yeh
Kidd and Killer are from South orc
Iirc
Shim
Do you still think Ulti and/or P1 is joining Kid?
Is it worth buying the physical copies for Jojos?
I like one piece
Part 5 is probably the one I’m most looking forward to
And yeh I’m like halfway through pt 2
4 looks good
3 looks like horseshit
7 also looks good
Lol these are all based on reading short spoiler free synopsis’ so i don’t really know
Haikyuu
Just more and more Haikyuu
||I know pt 4 has Kira, and he looks like a good villain so|| pt 4
I don’t know what I’m talking about so I won’t go further lol
Ugh Jojos just seems like such an arduous task smh
But I also want to read it
<:ok_Griff:452942412579471411>
You can just tell Mai’s bout to whip out an essay
Definitely a movie or are you willing to watch TV shows as well?
You should just hate me as much as possible now
So I can’t disappoint you anymore
🍑
Who’s corny tilted?
Zeph is a lovable weirdo
Ulti 4 nakama
<:rebki:374759708223078400>
So random
I know I don’t want Ulti lol. But the fact that people all said that when she appeared in 1 PANEL just shows this banbase’s capacity for stupidity
Yamato’s looking more and more likely now
But at the end of the day
I don’t really care
We have Jinbei
Apoo is the worst thing to ever exist
Actually makes me sick
That fucking Apoo vs Zoro and Luffy week damaged me
Powerscalers existence is a sin
Nah they can’t
Have you seen some of the most wild takes
<:WBDisgust:650047749831524372>
What’s rule no 1 of powerscaling
What’s worse?
Powerscalers or speedreaders/arc skippers
I’m a straight A student when it comes to One Piece knowledge
Test me
Pop quiz
I’m never wrong
<:AkainuLUL:726025066361651281>
I’m going to Harvard with powerscaling as my major
This class is a joke
And this teacher is a scam
Rigatoni 👌
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
Hmmmm
Rigatoni isn’t real
He can’t hurt you
It’s an old wise tale
Rigatoni is a figment of your imagination
What’s he gonna do?
<:BrookShrug:680559335058702376>
I can take it
I have the mental fortitude of a polar bear
Ok I’m prepared
Ok nvm
We’re back to one piece
Yep
They have much better control over it tho right?
That was stated right Choc? That they have to train their sulong?
Sulong is such a cool idea
Yes
All the minks will that’s why Neko said it lol
Coz Neko is better
I’m expecting big big things from Neko and Inu sulong
Realistically
Wtf is Raizo gonna do
That’s canon for me
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
Yes
If you read the first page of chapter 222
You know Usopp and Chopper are fighting the numbers
I think Sanji has called him Zoro 6 times iirc
And Zoro has called him Sanji even less
Now I don’t know if a scabbard will die actually
Kinda on the fence about it
Kanjuro I’m not counting
Ashura I can see
But I don’t think Kin of Denjiro will die
I don’t think he will
Arlongs the best villain in the series so you should reread Arlong park
<:BrookShrug:680559335058702376>

||Black Swordsman Arc Guts is very very edgy lol. But that's why we love him|| Berserk ch 4
BB only handed in Ace to gain the warlord position so he could break into impel down and gain crewmates
speedreaders
yep

yeh ur going pretty slow
you were on Zou for like 2 weeks
thats not a bad thing
fine
||that's why I love him|| Berserk ch 4
tch
Why don't people get this
<a:REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEGIF:393866924192432158>
read!!!
retention is gained through discussion?
so talking on discord is the best way to learn the story??
I really really really don't think it is
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
discussing it correctly
correct and accurate discussion builds retention
if people are spouting nonsense coz they can't be bothered to read the actual manga
it just wastes everyone's time.
gn
wait back up, what was ur first point, I missed it <@!268137256051539971>
that wasn't planned tho
no he didn't
<:SengokuPalm:701663557338529802>
where does it say that?
remember
BB is an opportunist
No its not
he handed in ace to get access to impel down
no just that
how tf are you gonna predict the biggest war in histroy
where does it say that?
show me the panel
BB didn't even know Ace was Roger's son
how did he know he would cause the biggest war ever
<:DoffEZ:586408476025028608>
to get to impel down
it's actually never been explicitly revealed how the marines figured it out
we can infer that they just did based on gathererd intel
it wasn't Garp lol
they just found out
it's never been explained in detail
why would they kill the hero of the marines
he can get away with literally punching a noble
Guys
I will literally find you the panel
give me a sec
he's being executed because they believe he could one day be PK like his daddy
here you go
lol Choc
read it
they believed he could one day be PK and cause more problems
2 of us have posted the panel that debunks your statement
like, its all explained in one chapter
Watch Haikyuu
you do
wait just animes or are you willing to read manga?
That is literally never stated
??????
are we reading the same story?
Blackbeard?
ok
I see
ohhh
nvm
I already saw this
I'm big dumb dumb
<:shutupretardstoptyping:736095674730414081>
gotta read berserk
is made in abyss ongoing?
the manga?
read Haikyuu
you won't regret it
I used to collect beyblades lol
I need to decide on what manga I'm gonna read after Berserk
coz for anime, I'm just gonna catch up to Gintama
oh I'm caught up to Vinalnd
have you watched s1?
it is
but I thought s1 was still good
gdi
didn't you say you did that with another series
or was that someone else
<:SengokuPalm:701663557338529802>
oh ur just Bokuto now
I should make a gif pfp
yes
I have never had an original idea in my life
so I have to steal
yeh irl people are overated
me neither
ngl, ur new pfp, when I first saw it, I thought it was Morgan Freeman for a split second
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
I'm sorry Mai
did you say
THANOS????
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
idk see it
I see morgan freeman
for the first slide
does no one else see Morgan Freeman???
but you see Thanos?
another try ... Doen you read 1 chapter
that doesn't count as a try
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
there's no snap emote?
<a:LuffySnap:701662015319441458>
oh look at that
<a:7874_RicardHOO:735441703045038201>
I like one piece ngl
the ultimate eye test
read the first line
wait is Chihayafaru a sports manga?
what sport
where's this list from
ah ok
is that the one with the dog on the cover?
I'm skimming through chapter 1 of Chihayafaru to see if I like the art
and I gotta say
its really good
I definitely will give it a read eventually
Big Mom asking if Kaido was dead with a smile on her face was actually funny af
we did it bois
we did it
<:CryBoy:585546888175157258>
I should be banned from this channel til I read more stuff
lol
ok, so I've been reading one piece for pretty much 10 years now
but for some reason it never occurred to me that there maybe more in this medium than just one piece
kinda crazy
I know
I was shocked when I found out
so gradually trying to build up my portfolio of manga
I treasured it while I had it
life goes on
!anilist
make an anilist
I much prefer the anilist UI but ur right, it's a matter of preference
yeh, for you elites, the xp gap is pretty big
k I'm gonna go read some more Berserk have a good one guys
Choc, I was curious about the user Zolo coz of all the memes so I went back and looked at some logs. Dude, you and him seemed to go at it <:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
yeh, I can't tell if he was trolling or not?
give me a life size sunny first
yeh
and I want it

click that
I'm down

kewl
ur good
<a:GutsMegaCry:721314623495733288>
only current chapter
so when early spoilers come out for new chapters, you gotta go to <#164996746429202432>
that would suck
heard he's biggay
"afraid"
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
are you caught up to the manga?
YAY
top 5 arc
you will love it
coz it's amazing
indeed
it's the best
maybe
are you reading or watching?
you should catch up before coming on here
Manga
imo
if you want MY opinion
the manga is better than the anime 10 fold
but you do whatever you want
you can read it in color now as well
if you want to do that
kuzan
kizaru is unclear justice
I haven't even seen every anime episode
!mangawhere
its linked there
colored manga is up to mid WCI
chapter 869
no
more lol
if its 6 years
how would we get to 1500??
not really
Oda can easily finish it in 5 years
I honestly don't see it going past 1200 chapters
probably not
ok if we get 38 chapters a year on average. that's excluding corona
we're at 987 now, so to get to 1200 with 38 a year, it already would take 5.6 years
it used to be around 3 a month
but corona has kinda cut that down to 3
2
well start getting ready lol
it's really not as far as you think
Goddam I’ve been asleep all day again
<:LUL:321931602655707136>

Hey Viri
<a:aWAHWaving:561303114871734302>

It’s actually been a lot better when you find a good therapist that DOES understand and figure you out
But that’s just me
And yeh I don’t wanna lower the mood lol

Go get some Grizz
You know you want to

Oh wow
2 pairs siblings
If my brother were on here he’d get banned instantly
You don’t wanna meet him
<@496362640688283649>
He can help
I’m sure there are plenty other people who can help. I just know the guy I pinged loves it a lot
😳
<a:aPES_AngeryArrive:666320713921331230>
NO
Coz there are no spoilers
So there’s no point in being in there
Damn
I guess I’m not strong enough <:Crydo:586275183032270849>
Yes make an Evan meme
We should have a contest
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
No not a server wide one
Just like 5 people lol
Yeh Syd, you don’t wanna meet this Evan guy
He’s a piece of shit
fats does come online a lot, he’s just on vacation for the last 2 weeks so he hasn’t
Paper cuts are the worst things ever
Idk, it was kinda a joke only meant for people here but yeh, if people want to make memes about me, go ahead. I could use a good laugh
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
I think that’s leaning on the political side of things
Idk
Ask Moe
Yeh ok let’s change topics
They are the same

Hello new here, I’m dad
Yes this is my dad Moe
And congrats

What’s the topic?
Are you starting the manga?
<:LUL:321931602655707136>

Tch
!faguto
That’s how gay that take was Fagu
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
Doom is good with making memes
I guess this makes me your enemy Emood
I’m surprised Zeph hasn’t been banned
He’d get yeeted back to Sabaody

Did you just edit that Doom?
Did you finish that moe meme Grizz?
Who? <:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
Wait 30 years then pick one piece back up
You’ll probably have forgotten by then

How are you so good at edits?
No you didn’t

why are you hyper?

<:MoriaFeels:544294371512811521>
from hot to not
You wanna know how Dressrosa had bad pacing in the anime
Coz it’s 102 chapters in the manga and 118 FUCKING EPISODES IN THE ANIME
how does that happen
They dragged everything
The mets are a joke
The knicks are a joke
New York is a joke
<a:aPES_Laugh:664885767574781964>
wait I was scrolling up, ||someone put the war arc as their favorite arc in naruto??|| Naruto Shippuden
very ... interesting
to me it's literally the worst arc in the series
15 pre ts 17 post ts
Tekking has good one piece knowledge
but his speculation is awful
and he's kind cringe
that's kinda weird
does he realize that when he asks the brick a question .... he's not gonna reply because .... he's a brick
yeh, but Chewbacca could at least go BRGHGGH, the brick can't do anything
its a brick
that's fine, I'm not gonna criticize another person's opinion
but to me, ||the arc was full of inconsistencies, asspulls, drawn out scenes, fan service, the fights weren't interesting at all (at least the ones at the end), it just became Naruto and Sasuke vs Madara, KAGUYA, and that's just a short reason why|| Naruto Shippuden
||And it was unnecessarily long, with just pretty superficial substance. || Naruto Shippuden
||All in all, probably the worst war arc I've seen, maybe besides bleach|| ^
yo fate
oh for sure

oh my god
you like the 4kids rap huh?
name every rap song?
I've never heard this before
was this the theme song?
ok, lets put it this way. If they are a competent new world combatant, they most likely have haki
I really doubt Jack doesn't have haki
he did
Ace was confirmed to have all 3 haki
ur right nvm
in the Ace novel which isn't canon, he uses armament, but it is not confirmed
my bad
at the time maybe lol
lol, people really expecting Oda to have planned EVERY single detail of the story since the beginning
Ace was never originally planned to be the son of Roger
but look where we are
but that's the nice thing about these long stories
not everything has to be planned
yep
I agree
I think that's what we were meant to believe
well we were
but I think that's what Oda believed as well
lol
is he on MF yet?
I haven't been keeping up
so how does he still believe Ace is Luffy's biological son?
ok Gaben sending me misinformation
<:Uso:637751966184767546>
he will
I watched the Thriller Bark one again
he won't like Dressrosa
at least as much as the others
He'll HATE sugar
imo
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
damn you Gaben
And I'm even more retarded for reading that retard's work
One Piece is stupid actually
I'm gonna go read more Berserk
That's a great manga Archer
has loads of Mechs and explosions
and comedy
It's one of Oda's best works
Purple Noon is a quintessential piece of Japanese literature
He reminds me of myself back in my youth
wait current arc of what?
I like Berserk
it's cool
really cool
I think I might start Berserk soon
really cool
and there's like 5 of them
lol
guys
I know this might sound crazy
but we actually have an entire channel where you can talk about Jojos
This is a ~~Berserk~~ One Piece channel
Speaking of Berserk
I'll say something in other series
Only compare the two if you've read them both lol
I disagree
you can easily rank arcs in one piece in terms of enjoyment
Berserk is better than Kingdom
take my word for it
I haven't read Kingdom
Berserk is slowly surpassing Vinland for me
and I'm only half way through
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
still birth ceremony
yessir
||I am loving Mozgus as a villain so far. Can't tell if he's an apostle or not. But yeh I'll give you my thoughts when I'm finished|| Berserk 140
around 140
can't remember
||I loved Isidro's introduction as well. I'll have to see more of him, but he seems cool|| Berserk
I read that as "I'm eating Lockers right now"
lol
||He seems like he'd make a good "Robin" to Guts' "Batman"|| Berserk
but I'll wait and see
Guts
probably
I do love ||Thorfinn ||tho
I'm saving up to get the other box sets
HAHA for a second I read that as "I'll get YOU box set 3"
what is wrong with me today
I'm going insane
I watched the 97 anime and the first 3 episodes of 2016
<a:runningemote:735442727239417917>
I needed to hear ||GRIFFFFFITHHHH||
you ever one of those days where it doesn't feel like a proper day
like it just kinda came and went
yep
I listened to guts' theme for 9 hours straight the other day
yeh I get that too
weird stuff
they haven't adapted the whole story at all
2016 Berserk is in my top 5 anime of all time
<:LuffyTruthful:671944878569160714>
yeh aren't they considered the old trio by the fanbase?
they should make a live action Berserk with the budget of GoT
<:CrocoDurr:663850964763279381>
even if there were a good anime
I know I would still the manga by far
Berserk fits black and white
digitally colored Berserk would make me vomit
||<a:GutsPunching:687736942644953151> ||
I have to spoiler tag an emote
lmao
<:CascaBlush:619644402293276694>
||I love Casca. One of my favorite female characters|| Berserk
||I mean nothing beats Slan in terms of female characters <a:dealwithit:448331229851287562> || Berserk
nah, Berserk in colored would be awful
And wdym, the 97 anime was <:ok_Griff:452942412579471411>
I was joking
dude agreed with me
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
the only reason one should consider watching 97 anime, is for guts' theme
boruto <a:PepePuke:654218964162838538>
wait do you mean the boruto manga is looking good artwise? Or that the actual story is good?
coz I can't believe either to be true
||I can't believed it skipped the Wyald stuff <:Uso:637751966184767546> || Berserk 97 anime
yeh
retarded

that's better
haven't seen it, but it's one of my friend's favorite movies
maybe one day I'll go back to the best haikyuu character
read it then
the anime is horrendous
I mean ... yes
but I wouldn't
that's a mans man Archer
you can't separate a man from his boat
THE MAX, I would recommend is 50 chapters. But honestly, everytime I reread, I do about 10 lol
to what
any suggestions
alright if you say so
how about this
OK I'LL CHANGE IT AGAIN
does anybody have any good Tsukki pfps?
if you do just ping me

not too serious coz people might think I'm edgy <:LULW:607641487429206106>

Wonderfully weird
I’m lying in bed
Sometimes I just gotta let it happen

<:BennGun:670691867620409359>
Shoot the bunny
Could’ve been better for jinbe’s first one yeh
There are people who believe Bello Betty is his mom unironically tho
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
Coz pugs are the best
I have one
They’re cute and funny but they’re also retarded
But look at this guy
Fate somehow made this conversation more confusing
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
Do we have a command for awkward silences?
Night Strongo
“Peons”
Yes we are indeed slaves to the night Zeph
Hate mobile omg
So many typos
My nicknames been relegated to just “Gay” now
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
<a:aPES_CryDrown:644479445637529620>
Ok cya
<a:runningemote:735442727239417917>
My friend, berries are equivalent to yen
I know to the other guy
So if Luffy is worth 1.5 billion berries, it’s more like 15 million dollars
Basically
Higuma would only be worth $80,000 five or take
Oda is known for his exceptional attention to detail
But imma be real
I don’t think he cares whatsoever about cabbage prices in a fictional universe
Juba, when do you sleep?
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
Fate is biggay
I wanna go to Alaska so badly
Juba, I’ll take that as a “never”
Are you better than Canada?
...
Nah Canada sucks. USA number 1
🇺🇸
Canada isn’t real
Just walk over there
Do you live in Alaska as well?
Awww that makes sense
You know the weirdest thing
That’s not real
We have a few Australians
Marc
Choc
Yeh
Does England exist?
Or is that fake as well
Cunk is Australian as well
Speak of the devil
Fates from Siberia
Africa
I know
I like North America
It’s pretty neat
Yep
<a:aWAHWaving:561303114871734302>
I just need Orochi to stay dead
And for Kaido to die
Those are my biggest bets atm I think
<:Crydo:586275183032270849>
Personal net
Bet
With Earl
is he a meme? or just a device used for speedreaders to complain?
I don't remember any of the fillers. Maybe a little of G8
<:MoriaFeels:544294371512811521>
I don't really watch the anime tho
I don't really read the manga either
I don't do either
Haikyuu number 1
<a:aPES_Laugh:664885767574781964>
beautiful haiku emood
it paid off
I started reading One Piece almost a decade ago
and I just turned 13
so..
black clover
yeh we suck
I gotta catchup fast
it's pretty much in the same place
I am actually really hyped for Inu and Neko sulong
next chapter is gonna be good
they saw each other on Zou
as well
I'm gonna delete that
I thought you said Zoro and NAMI
FUCK
REEEEEE
it's too early I can't read
<a:2657_scanlon:734110028931399821>
<a:2840_ReeGun:735441831290208306> <:CarrotWah:641689779930660865>
I have to eliminate the furry
carrot is gonna suicide bomb herself as well to defeat Peros
but he will only lose another arm
just need 4 minks to turn Peros into a nugget
i do
that would be funny
I'm gonna destroy from the inside
is it just you?
where tf is Jack
good joke, bepo being useful
I'm filled with bad opinions, that's why I'm so smart
Bepo is probably the one mink who can't go sulong coz he's a special boi
<:rebki:374759708223078400>
realistically, how do you think this little "scuffle" with Kaido will end for the scabbards?
probably
damn really
you think 3 are dying right now
yeh as once this fight with Kaido is done
shu aren't you anime only
no one say anything
carrot the traitor yeh
> That monkey at the start of zou was also a suspect <@!698761447835959337> THIS
I legit saw this
WHAT THE HELL
people actually thought that monkey mink was the traitor
I mean
my god
tbh, Carrot would have failed at being the traitor like she does at everything else, so I knew it couldn't be her
yeh
I guessed Kanjuro from the beginning
I guess I just have big brain
I legit did
I DID
no joke
I don't believe you
that's ridiculous
what is wrong with you people
believing fate over me
I bet Orochi is dead, I'm sticking by that
permanent name change
I meant, I already bet about Orochi
The bigger meme, is the reader
I really wanna know how Oven fucked up that badly
it has to be
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
character presumed to be dead shows up alive .... DRAGON
it's the only explanation <:CrocoDurr:663850964763279381>
from what
that would be funny
I don't know if any of Shanks' crew has a DF. At least not his main 3 guys
the monkey on the guys shoulder is actually a man with a zoan fruit
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
no
it is
I HOPE
he wasn't scared
you can't spell Luffy without Dragon
he did hit drake
he got yeeeeted
they're not sword
this is still the funniest, good luck sending fodders with riot shields <:LULW:607641487429206106>
I subscribe to the weevil being some artificial frankenstein human
that one
it's goated
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
Here's why Weevil could be a manmade creation like Frankenstein
1. look at the stitches 2. He's dumb af 3. He seems to have just come outta nowhere  4. He could actually have the dna of WB which makes him so strong 5. I can't think of another reason but I wanted 5
when Weevil turns out to be man made don't come crying to me
I will bet on it
yes
cringe
ugggh that's been posted so many times today
and I hate it
😡
I kill chat all the time
dw about it
<:Crydo:586275183032270849>
with your amazing comments
I just leave everyone speechless when I say something
that's why chat always "dies"
or the treasure was just the bromance between Luffy and Zoro
<:BrookShrug:680559335058702376>
<a:runningemote:735442727239417917>

it's ok
<a:runningemote:735442727239417917>
I honestly don't care who joins coz I got Jinbe
BUT

it's just colors really lol
I could give a shit about the spade pirates
I just like orange
yes
this channel is where you can talk about LITERALLY anything else, so might as well not even bring up anime/manga
well not literally anything else
but you know what i mean
it
it's coz he's invisible 👻
The rules here are perfect imo
you have no idea how annoying it can get when people can just post/say whatever they want
especially on a server this size
I think they're especially fair given how many channels we have for certain subjects
like if you wanna talk about latest one piece stuff, you go into manga
if you don't, you go into other channels
500k?
oh the reddit
nvm
the reddit is how I found this server
and I hardly use the reddit anymore
lol
kept getting muted
eh
I'm on most of the day
it's only really hectic on chapter days in <#164971940648321024>
i don't even bother that much anymore
but they added another manga channel which I thought was a great idea so that's good
last week
or two weeks ago maybe
it just got too crazy
coz yeh we may have 80k members, but only a fraction of that are active during the week, but on chapter day
oh boy
just a swarm
yeh pretty much lol
crazy
> everyone already knows eachother I wouldn't say everyone knows each other, I'm still getting to know a lot of people
There are definitely regulars I talk to frequently
yeh you too
you can call me Evan, JSG, anything really I don't mind
My name normally says Just Some Guy
but ...
^
probably why
yeppers
it's not for everyone
but I like it
yeh it's funny in places
morning fon
I haven't slept at all and it's 6 in the morning
definitely
it works yeh
if you wanna go to jail
If Pinocchio told someone that his nose grows longer every time he tells the truth, people would think he's telling the truth
something to think about
<:peepocringe:654396879332966420>
oof
age act
it was a cool concept
<:SengokuPalm:701663557338529802>
kinda a weird joke to make in the first place ngl
is there anything good from wsj besides one piece
bc is not good lol
I should give dr stone a try
bodybuilding manga when?
no way
actually I'm not surprised
lol
I haven't started CSM, but demon slayer and JJK are ass
imagine the competition arcs
just people flexing really hard
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
oh
oh it's womens bodybuilding lol
looks stupid
I've got plenty of sports manga to read so dumbbell nan kil moteru is not a priority
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
oh right
from the bleach guy right?
I can't tell if you actually like Haikyuu or not will lol
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
fair
it's pretty bad
ooooh
I thought the "i fucking hate it" was in response to my question lol
I'm biggay atm
didn't notice it at first
another sports manga?
sorachi still kinda JUST ended as well
does a year count as just ended?
how old is he?
was there drama?
I'm currently watching the anime
it's hilarious
hey hey hey, I watch like 1 episode a day
I don't think that's too bad
speaking of Berserk
I'm gonna go back to reading coz I'm about to finish the conviction arc
cya
most reliable source
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
why is it so unbelievable to think that he can wrap around any living thing within reason? He can literally MOVE
he doesn't need consent
stage 4 happens without fail
every time
TAKE OVER. Kinda implies that he can do it my force
I don't get your argument. You think the fruit is so bad, its only useful if the person complies?
that
that is such a retarded argument
this isn't a productive argument, where both parties are bringing valid arguments to the table. You're just bring half ass arguments and half of them are disguised as memes
THATS NOT RELEVANT TO THIS DISCUSSION AT ALL
also, this isn't me a normal human trying to put a piece of clothing on you. This is me actually BECOMING a jacket and putting myself on you
Zolo
Alex is the type of guy that is the most infuriating to "argue" with
lol
no
because ur points aren't really constructive at all
they're either passive aggressive or memes
and you are also unwilling to see the potential other side
it's like arguing with my brother
yes, please stop ignoring others points to push your brain dead argument. The discussion can't advance because you won't let it
I'm gonna leave before someone gets muted or banned
Doom, I'm not a mod, but I think it would be best to move on. This has seriously just divulged into insults
I hope it is
ok
what does that have to do with anything? lmao

he will be missed ... until he inevitably reappears in a cover story
<a:GutsMegaCry:721314623495733288>

yeh, so proficient to the point you don't even need to
that's my guess Doom

speaking of vegito
did you actually say this? Or is this just an edit
I didn't make it, but yeh it's pretty funny
but do you actually believe it
what's "mid admiral level" as well?
ok so it was a joke
good
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
surely not
lmao
<:SengokuPalm:701663557338529802>
k
it's not as bad as someone once saying on here the term "captain level". AS IN, pirate captain level. Literally ranging from Kuro to Kaido
Zeoh what makes you think you can take down Sawyer without going through me first?
"human level"
<:LULW:607641487429206106> <:LULW:607641487429206106> <:LULW:607641487429206106>
this has made my day Doom
<:RogerLaugh:675105907776159744>
it is true tho
one piece fans will literally attach the word "level" to just about anything
and yes bubs
I'd be honored to join the clown army
what are the criteria?
seems pretty elite
Oda LITERALLY told powerscalers to shut the fuck up, but yet they still exist
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
remember there were theories that Roger was super weak
how'd that turn out
lol
retards
but they existed
I would get AC
but
I won't
kettle guy?
Oven
lol
Kettle guy lmao
they should be taken seriously
just not solely for strength purposes
Laww, I'm checking now
I think it was anime only
I can't find it at all
yeh
it's not canon
yeh Brook never fought Oven
lol
in the manga
Sanji has a couple of clashes
For all the zorotards, there's almost as many sanjitards as well
why does hardly anyone have an unbiased stance on these characters
yeh Wow not true
zorotards are just louder
there are plenty of sanjitards
trust me
that's actually kinda true
there's a lot of "zoro haters" here
lmao
JUST APPRECIATE BOTH CHARACTERS FOR WHAT THEY ARE
godam
zorotard, sanjitard, who cares ..... at the end of the day, they're just retards
"ideals"
lmao
Zeph wants to create a better world
but zoro haters get in the way
it's quite funny watching a hardcore zoro or sanji tard state their opinions
you think they're trolling
but they just aren't
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
omg I'm leaving
why
why
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
that is one of the worst things I've ever heard in my life
OK STOP
Milk moon
How has Zoro been portrayed close to Luffy at all?
Kidd has
Zoro is not stronger than Kidd lol
yes
discord is acting very weird
because a user actually thinks Zoro is stronger than Kidd
lol
oh come on
really
Zoro has green hair, Sanji has yellow hair, I prefer Green so Zoro > Sanji <:shutupretardstoptyping:736095674730414081>
how some of you sound
People are saying Zoro could’ve beaten Doffy?
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
“Joke”
It’s serious
Momosagi and Chaton
<:CobySalute:638916402467569675>
Youss, that’s because it’s hardly ever a meme
They’re just that stupid
Cuck?
FMI > Dressrosa
Obvs not
You need serious help if you think that
Not even Fuji
Doffy would’ve turned him to mince meat
Favorite admiral
Propbably
I think there’s a reason there’s only human admirals
The only other race in the marines are giants iirc
Haha ace ded haha <:AkainuLUL:726025066361651281>
Big true swrml
<a:ZoroTatsumaki:485086475289886732>
The warlord system, while kinda stupid, was such an interesting concept. Love them
Not stupid as in I think it shouldn’t exist
Stupid as in, it was a very risky chance the marines took trusting some of the most dangerous pirates in the world
I love the idea
And yeh, it added many layers
And BB Bean
Buggy joining Shanks is pretty likely i think
Idk how else he’d escape the marines
Gonna eat brb

I've given up on matchup predictions
I'm too stupid
<:Crydo:586275183032270849>
<:WapolTriggered:587621943725916180>

ITS A JOKE

There was talk of playing MC

Zyph knows the feeling
I can easily tell Zyphyris and Zyrphy apart
I never called you Viri
I remember that
people still do that unironically in <#164971940648321024>
OOOOOH I dIdN't ReAlIzE iT wAs YoU jSg

Nah. There would be better ones
But idk
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
Yeh exactly
You can’t just decide give me a command
<:FujiWoke:638345772953370624> <:FujiWoke:638345772953370624>
I don’t care at all lol
<:LUL:321931602655707136> <:LUL:321931602655707136> <:LUL:321931602655707136>
This guy actually tried it lol
The Youss one?
No it’s still around
I know but the guy went into bots and said it
Or did you already say that
<:MoriaFeels:544294371512811521>
I’m sorry
I can’t read
I’m getting better
A cat
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
Thee Crocodile??!!?
Hello brother
<:ShanksYes:727411684095819856>
I was hit in the leg by a goat once
Wasn’t nice
Franky is not the goat Zyph. He’s a filler SH
Yeh
I can only be in <#164971940648321024> for 5 minutes at a time
Before dying
So do I
<#164971940648321024> is impel down
Whole cake island
Ohhhhh
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045> <:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
I’m big dumb dumb
That would almost be as bad as #powerscaling
Power scaling channel would be funny af
I would never speak
Just lurk
And watch the chaos unfold
Manga is #powerscaling life
Lite
Would be funny af
Imagine bringing back #nsfw
<:LUL:321931602655707136> <:LUL:321931602655707136>
<#164971940648321024> already is semi powerscaling
I get too heated in <#164971940648321024> I’m a different person
It actually has
I’m so glad you made it
Faction wars lol
I need <#738580480437387264> for chapter days
Chapter days in <#164971940648321024> makes me want to die
Especially you guys
Yeh that’s why I love the new channel
I do as much as possible
Regulars aren’t the problem in <#164971940648321024> it’s the “others” <:LUL:321931602655707136> <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Honestly I expected him to have taken a much longer break between the timeskip but Oda being the man he is, he only took like a month
Shit
Stop lying, there are no girls on the internet
<:shutupretardstoptyping:736095674730414081>
“Girls”
It is honestly the most infuriating thing
You’re actually having a nice educated discussion
THEN BAM
Nsfw Luffy
Literally what happens
Then you get one white name ask some really uncomfortable lewd question
THEN BAM
Gets banned
I only leave manga when I feel like I’m losing an argument
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
<a:runningemote:735442727239417917>
when I don't know how to reply to someone's rebuttal, I do what they call a "get the fuck outta there"
honestly, discussing with people like Doom, Bean, Archer, Choc etc ... is a great way to keep the story fresh in your mind
luckily
I know more than all of them so
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
flowchart
the most accurate thing in the world
you used it against Doen?
it's very accurate
number 4
happens without fail
EVERYTIME
they also just become really cynical a start straw manning
if you're not a manga reader
you shouldn't be in this channel
no this is specifically for the ONE PIECE manga
I prefer b and w for practically all series lol
?
manga is all canon lol
marineford was filler
all of it
> For example, Katakuri fight had way too many interjections from other scenes. With anime, simple edits make the fight more fluid. <@!263517029284184064> you edit ur the anime yourself????
wtf
so am I, but I'm still dumb as shit
<:CrocoKidEvenMoreDistorted:586469633419378704>
this is bate
bait
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
Character: Is simple minded Solution: Get smarter
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
<:shutupretardstoptyping:736095674730414081>
they're not gags
it's his character
he's a free spirited guy. Doesn't overthink things. Does stuff mostly off instinct and lets his guts and determination help him. He doesn't need to be this 400 IQ genius who's planned everything out
it's just an invalid statement
"sometimes"
you just joined
another speedreader looking at things so 1 dimensionally
I swear there is no nuance or thought to some people's opinions
wtf
why is it like speaking to toddlers
idk how to respond
stop saying things with no substance coz you can't be bothered to think a little deeper
lol
No, he asked you why you don't like certain things, and you basically answer with "coz I don't"
for all of them
It's not that we want in depth answers
**Please Read This** it's just really annoying to try to have a discussion with people who don't bother to delve a little deeper into the material and just look at things so one-dimensionally. It's not that you;re not allowed an opinion, it's just that your opinions are annoying for discussions coz they lack substance.
> Can yall shut up so I can see this discussion they are not answering yall <@!606196171307745308> this is the discussion
lol
move to Alaska
that is objectively wrong but whatever
that doesn't make any sense
manga sjw
Listen <@!742887438720172235> I really respect people having their own opinions. But this is a discussion channel. Saying you don't like something because of something as vague as "coz they're generic" adds literally **NOTHING** to the conversation. And only creates ranting like this.
and then it just divulges into back forth nonsense where the discussion can no longer proceed. If you wanna say a hottake, go ahead, but make sure you have actual substantial points so the conversation can **develop**.
lol Spice, one day my dream will come true
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
ok perfect timing, coz I have to walk the dogs
oh coz of pfp
I like Mai so I'll take that as a compliment
lol Albair
aight brb
aight I'm back
<a:pogdance:449705087124635668>
nah had to walk the dogs
don't start this again
lol
oh Lami's here
yo



Oda is actually the best omg
few others go put this much care into every single detail
the goat
it's an amazing ship what can I say
lol imagine, if Robin just told Luffy out of the blue, "oh btw, I met your brother Sabo, who you thought has been dead for the last decade." How do you think that would turn out lol
yeh exactly
what makes you think Luffy would believe/accept Robin
that's not something you just say
Fright, you seem to look at these things with a pretty closed mind without taking the time to consider other possibilities
stop dismissing things as stupid
just because you don't like them at first glance
saying "that's just logic" literally proves you don't look at things with an open mind
it's frankly just annoying, coz the discussion is forced to come to a halt
ok
please stop
no
there's a thin line between being a troll and just naturally being infuriating
no need
it's easier to separate someone's gender from them saying stupid thing
Robin is perfection
no
I will not be doing that
lol
it was about time
really?
that's true Discord
I always get suspicious when it says "I'm new to discord say hi"
you can't be that new surely
yep
> vegito called it like an hour ago <@!272064319661801473> the only thing Vegito has gotten right today
nothing
hopefully moving onto a more interesting discussion
no
I refuse for you to be new
We should have entry applications <:LULW:607641487429206106>
with really bizarre questions
yes
let me make an entry application
filter out the alts
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
yes, and the mods must council each other as to whether or not people are allowed to join
yes
red was the 5th member to join
I technically joined at the end of 2018 on another discord account. But I made a new account when I moved back over to the US. But I don't think I said anything back then so I don't really count it
I thought you joined in 2019?
oh
nvm
you can
this was your first comment
I started reading OP during Punk Hazard so ...
2011 or 2012 I think
idk
nice
search up your name
no
top right
search bar
if you're on mobile I can search it up for you <@!606196171307745308>
this is how many messages you've sent
yeh
I'm almost at 40k <:Uso:637751966184767546>
coz u turned off spoilers
probably
lol
wassup
<:Uso:637751966184767546>
yes I'm a dick
don't talk to me
500k just seems insane
Roro had over 400k as well
yeh
I think Moko has over 300k
iirc
badass
a video?
he made an entire video?
lmao

Killua
^
a hug
even better
I gotta get to 100k soon
so I can finally be free
<a:pogdance:449705087124635668>
invisible
I will bet you I hit 100k by the end of 2020
go full no life
doom has the most
active regular = too much free time
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
I'm free for the rest of the year
I'll hit 100k no problem
that's fair
that's a smart plan Strong
I like it
If I get banned I'll just make my own server called r/r/OnePiece
it will specialize in powerscaling
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
yeh he's from Charlotte
pretty cool
lol
what is this game
it's insane
Yeh screw Evan, hate that guy
such a loser
I'm so jealous of how smart and handsome he is
ugggh

<:LULW:607641487429206106>
I'm so glad he ended up in Portland
great fit for him
yes I'm called Henry
as well
for some reason
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
Juba, I'm rooting for you guys
dude
I'm actually scared
Blazers are a tough matchup
especially for first round
yeh, but I'd rather the first round be a cake walk
yeh we have our own set of problems to deal with lol
gdi, I miss Avery
could have helped subdue Dame a bit
insane game
sorry Hog
looks like Memphis are <:PES_HahaDead:585724566824026132>
if we can keep the series to 6 games or under
won't be too bad
7 would be a pain in the ass
I'm only here when I'm not here
I like that green yeh
but the cool kids use orange
<:PES_NotCool:643089267953762304>
<:PES_CoolBiker:672161497526304795>
idk, bad emote
I literally knew you were about to say that
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
<:NamiPray:661055694476410910>
I've got that covered
I'm the funniest person I know
<:ApooPoint:714023366356500531>
I agree, it’s really not that relevant. It’s not gonna make him live til 25 or something
If he ends up living to 60 who cares
He’s not
Spice, tag me in
It’s been on and off for me today fats
Are you on mobile?
King
Oh if MEE6 is down then yeh
But sometimes ! rank doesn’t work for me on mobile
That’s not what he’s doing at all
some guy is gonna have a nice surprise waiting for him <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Jinbe being with Luffy rn is probably the best thing for achieving his goal
Wait aren’t we all agreeing on the same thing?
Who’s the jinbe hater?
Oh
Nvm
Not meshing?
They all jumped on him when he returned
They seem pretty glad to have him on Bird
Bird
BAORD
BOARD!!!!
I think Jinbe is the best SH addition post ts
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
It was a joke
Oh ofc Laww
I don’t get the argument that Jinbe doesn’t fit in with the crew. I don’t mind people not liking Jinbe or wanting him. But I think it’s objectively wrong that he doesn’t “fit in” on the crew
Jinbei has had a pretty seamless transition imo
CaP
How is it cap
You personally not wanting him on the crew doesn’t make his transition not seamless
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
I think it’s pretty dumb to say he doesn’t fit in on the crew. It’s purely you not liking him and not looking at the situation objectively
Exactly as fats said
Being a goof and quirky doesn’t make you “fit in” on the SHs
Jinbei has been the perfect addition to the crew imo
That’s why I could really care less who joins after
Yeh Laww
If I wasn’t on mobile rn I was gonna bring up that panel
A few people apparently
Which is fine
Yamato is the most likely candidate for “next sh” as of now
That’s if we even get one tbh
You said it doesn’t he doesn’t feel like a natural or seamless fit onto the crew. Which is pretty vague and really just translates to I don’t really want him on the crew. Because there is plenty of things that debunk that “doesn’t fit” statement
Which is pretty arbitrary to begin with
Dying?
Lol
He’s also a chonky boi
Carrot: Annoying, smells bad, and causes allergies
Not my SH
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
Sorry Laww

Did someone @ me?
!rank
Ask me
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
I unbanned myself
Akainu had plot Armor??? <:LUL:321931602655707136>
I think the fact that he **did **survive, is more of a testament to his insane and comparable strength to yonkos, and less of "plot armor" lmao
yes
<:voulkhug:721081052596142090>
Buggy becoming this "legendary" pirate would be really funny and I hope Oda does it
it's already building up
but like we skip to 50 years in the future, and people are telling their grandkids about how powerful and legendary Buggy was even tho it's all bullshit
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
that would be great
<@!377670308280139784> she's mine
lmao Fuji, <:LULW:607641487429206106>
you do it, see if she's yours as well
just scroll up a little
HAHAHA, I did it again and got fucking Ricardo
what is this
Heaven you say <:LuffyThink:701983952482599032>
I can see that
yeh for the love of god
please don't make every ancient weapon inhabit a persn
1 is enough
we probably will know for sure
it's Akinator
Yamato is looking very very good right now
as in looking good to join
not literally looking good
but she is that as well
nvm
Usopp
"Readers can feel close to Usopp since he is not a strong crewmate." Here is the quote from oda so for the people who say he will suddenly become a "commander" for Luffy, I very much doubt it. (idk what a SH commander is lmao)
Chris Hanson server lmao
Zeph has immunity from bans
Haikyuu will be at the top forever coz it's the best <a:TendouYess:666176413698621470>
yeh CNN made an article about Sabo's whereabouts <:CrocoDurr:663850964763279381>
Yamato with cuffs: One shots Ulti  Yamato without cuffs: Telepathically disintegrates her into oblivion <:bigbrain:690650741991276607>
Shanks shoulda been replaced with Thunder McGuy change my mind
<a:runningemote:735442727239417917>
wait what happened to #alsomanga
??
yeh, I think it will most likely be his one piece design
Sanji level?
is that a thing
lol
Luffy was about to be forced into G4 if it wasn't for Yamato
literally says it
you always arrive during prime shitpost hours
lmao
<:PES_ReeCowboy:585724569617170432>
*insert ecstacy of gold"
shit
I remember reading that in my textbook when I was a youngin
Western outlaws were notorious for their meticulous craftsmanship of stone cubes
fleebs just reacted with <:ZoroNut:632474447462400010>  before he even said anything
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
wait someone said the one-shot takes place in Wano??

I'm not saying he's this dragon race
DAMN YOU ZEPH

gdi Marc
smarts or intelligence is a very vague term
obvs Luffy is an idiot. But he also isn't in many regards
same can be said with Robin
<:shutupretardstoptyping:736095674730414081>
based
If he doesn't like your names, **he gives you a new one**
Chad
Doen ur a doodoohead

They “made” them fight lmao
I agree
||I’m not actually enjoying this arc as much as I thought I would|| MHA latest chapter
“Cut out to be”
Didn’t say “strong enough to be”
All it meant was that she had the potential to rise to the top of the ranks
No
That’s coz Carmel didn’t know what the fuck she was talking about
I guess I do <:shutupretardstoptyping:736095674730414081>
ALL THE ADMIRALS ARE ALREADY FUCKING STRONG
strength isn’t the problem here
Literally all it is
Ugh some of you power scaling junkies can be so brain dead sometimes
Literally means the same thing
Strength has nothing to do without, because all the candidates are ALREADY FUCKING STEONG
OMG
The candidates are already admirals
WTF
you're implying the strongest admiral must become fleet admiral
Obvs no one fucking thinks T-bone could become fleet admiral
you implied that the fleet admiral position is chosen with strength as a factor
when that is not true at all
EXACTLY
Vegito, you're contradicting yourself
But Vegito
The candidates are already admirals
I know, but out of the admirals
"the strongest" one isn't instantly chosen to become Fleet admiral
Vegito
If the admirals, who are all freakishly strong, are the only candidates. Strength should not be the main issue. BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY STRONG.
yes but, when the gorosei or whoever decides who they want to promote out of the admirals, they don't go "I wonder who has the biggest dick and can blow the most shit up, we should choose that guy"
but the "Luffy" part is already established in all the admirals
it's whether or not they have the "nami" part
<:SengokuPalm:701663557338529802>
yes
strength isn't a factor anymore when you're already the strongest in the marines
<:CrocoDurr:663850964763279381>
for family?
he wacked Stelly in the face coz he was annoying
literally violating his duty
Garp actually cares about protecting the peace
he's actually a very idealistic guy
for the marines
he just doesn't care for the CDs or nobles, because he understands that they can get in the way of peace
but that's kinda redundant when the candidates are literally ones who already have that strength
people like T-bone aren't even considered
spandam isn't part of the marines
Lucci doesn't respect Spandam at all
Dragon's gonna have a very interesting backstory
you don't think we'll get one?
<:FujiWoke:638345772953370624>
I'm just counting down the days until my Luffy, Dragon, Garp teamup panel
it will happen
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
<a:REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEGIF:393866924192432158>
Akaii, I will make it happen
idc who it's against or where it is, or how long it lasts
I just want 1 panel
<:NamiPray:661055694476410910>
yeh I'm banking on Imu being a woman as well
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
Evaning <a:aWAHWavingBack:561303247512403980>
yeh Fon
go for medicine so you're parents won't be disappointed in you
like me
<:CryBoy:585546888175157258>
you mean a role?
oh nice
but I know Oda will give me a better one
Choc shut
<:BennGun:670691867620409359>
Monkey D. Kong
I can't believe people think that
that's the only reason
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
are you responsible for this Choc
<:BennGun:670691867620409359>
One Piece fans: >Kong >Kinda sounds like Donkey Kong >Donkey Kong is a monkey >Monkey D. Luffy >ofc >Kong must be a monkey d >Monkey D. Kong
<:CrocoDurr:663850964763279381>
I appreciate that fon
well his family do have it
what just happened?
ha Lami
she's dead
<a:aPES_Laugh:664885767574781964>
Cora should've lived and Law should've died
oh god
Rocks D Nami
do people think that?
god it gets worse by the day
Usopp for sure isn't a D
I doubt Nami is but she has more of a case than Usopp even if the chances are practically 0
<:FujiWoke:638345772953370624>
no Akaii
I need to check
We DoN't KnOw HeR rEaL pArEnTs
<:shutupretardstoptyping:736095674730414081>
Zoro is more likely to have CoC than Nami is to be D lmao
yeh that's so weird Viri, you and me literally have the opposite situation
didn't you say your parents wanted you to be in finance or something
wow fate
what's it like
Zoro has very powerful coc
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
LOL
Zoro is literally powered by his fanboys
deal
mochi is the only one
Yeh she's half Charlotte, Half Monkey D. (BM and Dragon) Charlotte Monkey D. Nami
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
I'll burn them first
gdi YC
Water doesn't mean anything, Oda probably just wanted it to sound like Waterloo
yeh
isn't that actually a theory YC?
Brook and Kuzan
Every stupid theory has a couple of retards behind them, just gotta know where to look
that's one of the most infuriating things to hear honestly
I love this panel coz it briefly makes you think Rocks was some midget when its actually just everyone else is 20 ft tall
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
Of course they would Viri
Roger was 9 feet tall so I'd say around there
not Kuma lol
what makes you say that??
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
<:ShanksYes:727411684095819856>
If you're not 9 feet tall, ur midget in one piece
<:CrocoDurr:663850964763279381>
> Tsuru is as tall as LeBron <@!439770223944400896> that's cursed lmao
Sizes in one piece are gret
Merry the midget
that's good logic
I really doubt they'll be explained
it's just to add to the mystery and world of one piece
<@160778857702490113>
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
ofc
I think so
Yasopp will just reply to Usopp telling him she's dead with a simple  "oof"
Crocomingo
no fake bullets either, none of that p*ssy shit
real bullets
I still think BB will kill Shanks so Yasopp getting killed could happen
not Mihawk
lol fagu
ok his whole crew doesn't have to be massacred lmao
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
<:BBZehahaha:586271941627871234>
stronger yeh
maybe the monkey man is the doctor
<:BrookShrug:680559335058702376>
almost 80
909-987 so far
so 78
yeh
Sanji is fighting Avalo Pizarro in my head canon
north blue royalty
that's a good point Dora <:LULW:607641487429206106> <:LULW:607641487429206106>
<:CrocoDurr:663850964763279381>
ofc Doom
and Doom
Sanjuan Wolf is only YC7 level
<:CrocoDurr:663850964763279381>
ok let me see if I remember this
1. Burgess 2. Shiryu 3. Augur 4. Pizarro 5. Lafitte 6. Devon 7. Sanjuan 8. Vasco Shot 9. Doc Q
I believe that is which commander runs which ship
someone check
oh lol ofc
make it happen
<:MoriaWide:625735023668232202>
Oda missed his chance to make the shadow on the water Moria
Oda is such a bad writer smh
<:Uso:637751966184767546>
yeh that is kinda strange
I wanna see what interaction went down
ok let's talk about that for a sec
Was that actually Hawkins
yeh
that's my thinking
how could it be hawkins
Caribou is 100% the shadow that was following Jinbe and robin
I've confirmed it
Franky and Brook
there's no way this is Hawkins yeh
YES
coz it's happening Doom
it's happening
The prophecy
smaller
I think
coz they Kid said Hatchi or whatever his name was looked taller than giants
yeh
yeh Arsal
I sorry
Weren't they meant to come round the side like a pincher formation?
the back was the scabbards and Law's group
Good morning
I love that aspect of the plan
it's only to get to Kaido and BM successfully
still kinda confused as to where Zoro and Kidd are
they're still in front of the dome right?
oh below
yeh idk why I said BM
no
Idk what else people want tbh
people think that  if the allies suffer a major casualty/tragedy the raid is a failure
like no
it's only a failure if they're wiped out
yeh you're right it's just semantics and technicalities and certain people want certain things. At the end of the day, the only certainty is that the allies will end up winning
failing and them having to regroup and form an entirely new plan would be a huge waste of time and investment
I agree
but then why "kill" him in the first place
I guess Higurashi thought he would do something useful with it
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
that's a good point
yes Doom, but I feel like bringing him back would be **very high risk**, and a decent reward ig. There aren't many routes Oda could take with Orochi now that I can think of, that would one, make sense, and two, feel worth the trouble of bringing him back
I would hate that
shock factor for the sake of it
yeh, he didn't have to work very hard let's say that
lmao
I'm very on the fence about the whole Orochi "death" situation
<a:7860_bob_danceing:738791613446488078>
I'm hungry
many things
the funny thing is Moe, I feel asleep, at like 9, woke up at like 1 or something, and literally the minute after you went to bed, I came back online
me?
yeh kinda atm
that's a very useful skill to have
Fon the funny thing about opinions, is they're opinions
other than a few exceptions
one's is never better than the others
ADEMAS
bullying people into liking something is a very good tactic
if anyone bullies me join in
yes
<a:pogdance:449705087124635668>

no way he'd remember me
lmao

so I've seen him
is a better word
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
geez
I believe, if you win against the nets on thursday
you'd have to lose both of your play-in tournament games to not make the playoffs

Rogersbase: ugh, a character in a fictional story has amnesia, I'm going to react with a proportionate response by destroying my room. Definitely not because I'm recording this. This is a perfectly sane and rational response to such an infuriating response. grrrrr
unless he thinks his audience are a bunch of 4 year olds, his "cringe" is 100% superficial nowadays. At least the **really **cringey stuff

Berserk 176, <@!373144491005313025> ||ok, I'll give you my thoughts on the arc as whole soon, but just a tiny bit confused on a few things (If they are explained in the future you don't have to tell me). Okay first: How was the demon child of Guts and Casca protecting her this whole time? And secondly, how did the egg of the perfect world somehow turn that child into Griffith. Is it because Griffith tainted it when he raped Casca or something?||
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
lmao
oh I drew that Doom icon
ugh Berserk is too good
but yeh just gotta keep reading
thank you tho
Berserk 176 Conviction Arc "Review" ||This was easily another 10/10 arc but I'll try to go in order because there was a lot of material lol  **Lost Children**: I'm assuming most people think of Birth Ceremony when they think of Conviction, but I still really enjoyed Lost Children as an "isolated" story. Felt very fantastical and mystifying which I really enjoyed. Really nice themes of innocence, naivety vs reality, abandonment and what "home really is". Also nice take on the "mystical fairy trope". Really felt like a twisted fairy tale.  **Birth Ceremony**: This was peak manga, comparable to the second half of GA. The writing, art, themes, characters, and ending were all perfect imo. Really enjoyed returning to Rickert and Godo at first. Godo's speech to Guts when he was dying in his bed was amazing. Miura is clearly reinforcing the idea that Guts is **human**. In such a dark and fucked up word, he feels fear, anger, vengeance, etc. I love how he called Rickert and Casca irreplaceable, but then comes to the realization that he actually abandoned those things to sate his uncontrollable rage. Guts is becoming one of my all time favorite protags. The Holy Iron Chain Knights were pretty cool. I really like Serpico and feel like he will be much more relevant down the line. This seemed like setup for Farnese's character and I can see her having a lot more development soon. And Azan is Azan. Isidro is the fucking man. Perfect "sidekick" character. Robin to Guts' Batman. Mozgus was an amazing villain. Religion is always a cool aspect to explore in fantasy stories and I thought Miura wrote Mozgus's obsessive religious zeal perfectly. I was really intimidated and honestly creeped out by him. Felt like this actual threat that couldn't be reasoned with even before he gained powers. Then of course, the fucking ending. Running out of characters so, yeh just perfect ... again.||
ok fuck
ran out of space
lol
LOL, ||nah I just kinda chucked it in with Birth Ceremony coz it was only 8 chapters or something|| Berserk
yeh, it's definitely one of those series you could write an essay on

the most useless sight
3 choppers I assume
BM is basically 29 feet tall
yeh
looking at it
Monster point was much taller than Kuma who is 23 feet
BM is 29 feet
So Monster Point chopper should actually be taller than BM
yeh so Monster point is definitely taller than BM I'd say
who's a waifu?

I respect that Koya is a girl, but I do not respect koya
I hate her

I play piano, guitar, (violin), and a tiny bit of the french horn lmao
I only feel confident in piano and a little bit of guitar
yeh same
Piano is the only one I'm decently competent in
I play guitar for fun mainly
self taught
Self teaching myself guitar was actually really fun
but yeh, Piano is my main thing
and even then, I'm sure fats and Juba are much much better than me
something like that fate
left hand was my greatest enemy for years
genius
are you left handed fatsu?
ooooh
you're a witch
burn him
lefties used to be executed for witchcraft
yep
I agree fate
it's unnatural

this channel only allows talk about things that have happened in the anime, so no manga spoilers
it's about a year behind
I sent a request to Pasta

ye
they want me to simp for their favorite series
so depending on the mood
oh yeh I wonder which channel I've spoken in most
general or manga
ok definitely manga
yep
I hate to admit
you notice
that it became better when I joined
<a:runningemote:735442727239417917>
oh 100%
recently
coz fats typoed with Goy
<#164971940648321024> is either infuriating, educational, or memesical
no normal
<#513312224048185345> is how I met Pasto
talked about Ozark
now me and Pasto are brothers uwu
yeh music is just mainly people putting osts
which is cool
but I like it when Sab and Juba post stuff in music
just leech off of their taste
so I don't have to find it myself
NOOO
<:Uso:637751966184767546>
lol
I'm not the biggest fan of his music either. I just listen to it to try and broaden my "taste"
of for sure
oh
he's a very well rounded guy ngl
cya zfb
he knows a lot about everything somehow lmao
kinda like Doom
the SAO opening lady
and KnY
my brother is obsessed with her
LiSA got married recently I think fate
sorry bud
<:WapolTriggered:587621943725916180>
ADAMAS is my favorite of hers
haven't even watched that part of SAO lol
Berserk 176+ ||Is Miura a big Star Wars fan or something, coz this arc is called Falcon of the Millennium Empire. Kinda sounds like Millennium Falcon if you ask me <:LuffyThink:701983952482599032> ||
I know the problem
it's actually Choc
**EVERY TIME**, there's a stupid troll, you are here

you attract them
ah so my deduction skills were correct.
<:bigbrain:690650741991276607>
#haikyuu when?
march 2016
I think
wasn't even born when this server was made
Is there anyone on here who has followed one piece since day 1
or at least like within the year it came out
that's still impressive
really
I've been reading since PH so I think 2011
marineford Choc?
lucky
you could take him
**SWEEP THE LEG**
I will
<a:aPES_Fight:652091181056000033>
I got Joe next on my list
I've decided
fuck Jojo idc anymore
I'll finish it eventually
yeh I've heard Joe is great
I only read one series at a time
GLT?
what is that
oh right
Red got me into Haikyuu
I'm the opposite
I'm not busy with life
so I gotta start the series
all of jojos?
the manga?
Sab read Haikyuu
Isn't Moe reading Haikyuu as well
or is he already finished?
<@!145193576165408769> have you finished Haikyuu?
Haikyuu is like on par with One Piece for me lmao
Haikyuu is amazing
I finished it in a couple of weeks
I think
gn
GTO was also in consideration for me, but people convinced me more towards Joe. So unless someone gives an amazing case for GTO, I'm gonna start Joe next
how many chapters is joe again? like 200?
yeh I'm just gonna do that Will
above is the greatest ost to exist
Ugh, I just feel like I'm missing something because I haven't read fucking Jojo's
idk
honestly
lmao
that may be so, but it just feels like Jojo's is a must read regardless of how good it is
but you have read it right?
I secretly feel I want to tho
it's whether it takes priority over other stuff
Finished Conviction arc last night for Berserk
<:ZoroNut:632474447462400010>
Berserk 176+ ||By the title of the arc, I'm assuming I'm gonna see a lot more of big daddy Griffith, aka the goat||
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
naisu
you I wrote a review for conviction earlier but I ran out of space and didn't get to talk about the ending lol
when Archer sees a rhetorical question, he makes torical
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
he was fine
Read Musashi instead
jk
I like Vagabond
like half of it
maybe not even
2 years ago
coz Musashi by Eiji Yoshikawa is my favorite book of all time
at least one of them
as someone who's worked in Barnes and Noble, I too don't remember seeing HxH in there
I didn't realize REAL was still ongoing
I thought it was over
yep
tbf, when I worked there
they were selling the color walks
so copped me a few of those
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
lol Archer
the Berserk hardcover volumes on amazon
are like 40 bucks each
yeh I've heard that as well Will
so stupid
KnY is ass
Viri knows the struggle of being a twin
but I think she has another brother
whereas I only have my fuck nut of a twin
yes
but then again
that's not very hard
yeh
bro
<@126483707182710784> Star Wars spoilers I guess, not really
that's me and you
uh, my brother is older emood

baba booey

how many members you got
ik, but what about the mha server
NANI
how
MHA sucks compared to One Piece
very random Ana
lmao
wooooow, so she gets her artist role back, but I can't get my sexy guy role back
jk
**IT'S A JOKE**
I'm reading Berserk
what's the best place to read Joe btw?
oh right
yeh
wait why does it say ch 111 is the last chapter on mangadex?
I thought you said there were like 170
ooooh
ok
ty
it's in my top 3
I think I prefer the foundation trilogy
if you're into sci-fi books I recommend that a lot
I'm sure
definitely read Dune first
it's a must
sci-fi isn't for everyone, but I don't know a single person who hasn't enjoyed Dune
and most of them don't care for sci-fi
oh bye emood
I'm too late
<:Crydo:586275183032270849>
yeh I know Dune loves Doom
wait
Doom loves Dune
lmao
oh is zfb leaving?
Bye zfb
<a:aWAHWavingBack:561303247512403980>
what's it about?
oh nice, guess I have to add that to the list as well
added planetes recently to my list, so I guess one day I might start a sci-fi manga binge
👽
k gonna have a shower then read Berserk
have a good one

I'm currently watching Gintama as well
but very slowly
if someone fervently recommends something to me, as in, it's their favorite series, I'll probably give it a try
2000 words Mai
yes choc
probably
if you truly believe it's a 10/10
I will eventually try and watch it
yeh as someone who hasn't read the manga, I love the movie lmao
well I didn't know what your 10/10s were
so if you have at as a 10/10 then I'll give it a try eventually
oh it's only 26 episodes Choc
I'll definitely give it a watch eventually
Silent Voice movie, ||yeh the grandma is one like 1 or 2 scenes then just dies lmao||
gn moe
I wonder if Caesar could diffuse through the barrier fruit?
oh yeh true
lol
<@!352259806985322506> I checked the logs, you started berserk on the 7th and finished on the 9th
<:ApooPoint:714023366356500531>
I tend to be the opposite
I definitely prefer manga and will choose manga over anime most of the time
really good
yeh at least 2 a day, but yesterday i watched like 4 I think
lemme check
ok, when I first started watching Gintama, I got to episode 50, but since I forgot everything I restarted, so rn, I'm on ep 35
yeppers
I'm glad they did that
I also don't like being confined to having to watch 20 minute installments structured by other people
I like reading at my own pace
if that makes sense
ngl
one piece kinda turned me off of anime
I don't really watch it anymore
like with Gintama
I've been told the anime is much better especially for appreciating the comedy
but for most series, I definitely would choose manga over anime
no
I'm probably not even going to when I eventually catch up to the anime
because I think they're animating the final part next year or something
iirc
lmao
yeh hopefully I'm caught up by january
but that's what I'm liking about Gintama
there's really no need to watch like 30 episodes straight
MHA latest manga chapter ||I'm really not enjoying this current arc that much. Kinda disappointing imo||
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
to answer your question
I sincerely hope no one is
jk
if you like it, that's cool
but I know a lot of people don't
I don't really care for shonen outside of One Piece a maybe a few others
explain that shit rn Zeph
or else
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
oof
> Nope. I just looked all this shit up <@!274366418223497217> that's a science in of itself. The science of making yourself sound smart by relaying smart people's knowledge.
is HxH your favorite shonen?
I see
ugh why aren't my berserk files loading
no
yeh, and for some reason the pages won't load
ok wait
they loaded
<:ok_Griff:452942412579471411>

Good morning
I love the iron balloon analogy for BM
“Base”
Even if it was extremely different, who tf cares
It was 500 chapters ago
Lmao
post Enies lobby was around 2005-06 iirc
Somewhere around there
Yes that chapter was released in 2006
By Koby san
<:KobySalute:647335491410067489>

I need to make one
To represent my inner alpha chad
Morning Fon
No
One piece will 100% not be ongoing for another 17 years
Not even 7 but I won’t get into that
Therefore you should believe them
They are superior fans
And have more comprehension to the story than us lowly plebs
I think Ohara face revealed
Morj pissed me off recently
No not because of that
Because he made a video saying that Kaido would not die, giving Mr. Earl of Gyoza this strange sense confidence boost for our bet
Lmao
Yeh
No
Lol
?
I believe he’s stopped smoking, or at least drastically reduced it
I think that was for a stretch of chapters/arc
Not all the time
During his breaks he spends a lot more time with family.
I believe they live in separate houses while he’s working
I may be wrong on that tho
The sad thing is fats, a lot of people are always like “mangaka would be a dream job”, but once you hit Oda’s level, the emotional and physical tole over the years is actually quite tragic
Wait
It’s a drawing?
I thought it was like a make your own trainer website or something f
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
Haikyuu is better
<a:runningemote:735442727239417917>
You should it’s better than one piece
<a:aPES_Laugh:664885767574781964>
Even if I were being serious, how does best selling = better
I’m getting a haircut on Friday
It’s a tragedy
<a:aPES_CryDrink:678210605781352448>
Luckily I was being facetious so ..
I’m tired of all these “you look homeless” comments
I’d like to grow it long at the back one day
But mine just grows everywhere
Hey
It’s constant rain and thunder here
So annoying
It’s hot during the day
But for some reason I’m the evening it’s thunderstorms recently
I just love Washington state man
I always think about moving back there someday
Good question

Crazy
Dame is an animal
Woah 154 points in last 3 games lmao
<@!373144491005313025> **Berserk 190** ||I like their backstory because it showed how dark the world in Berserk is from 2 polar opposite sides of society. Serpico was growing up in poverty and really just went through the motions of life. Didn't have ambition or hope, just looked after his mother and survived. I loved that scene where he's just lying in the snow, not even trying. Whereas Farnese, grew up in nobility and wealth, and yet is also suffering from isolation and lack of purpose. I love how them coming together "completed" each other in a sense.||
panicked lol
not clutch
<:LeBronFlex:596739222950641684>
||I'm glad about that, because during Conviction, on surface level, she was "dislikeable". That's why I was eager to learn more, because I could tell it was a lot deeper than what it seemed at first.|| Berserk 190
gonna keep reading, hopefully finish a couple more volumes tonight

good night guys
So GoH any good?
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
Wasn’t planning on watching it anyway
Almost done with Jojos part 2
It’s 1000% referring to the crew
Marco had a reason to know about Teach
Same crew for decades
Luffy and Zoro just met the guy and didn’t have any type of haki then
How tf would they know if he had “many souls”
Or whatever people think
It’s referring to how dangerous the BB pirates will be
It’s referring to the crew
No mystery
It’s literally referring to the crew
Wdym and?
Yeh it’s interesting how they could tell how dangerous BB and his crew were back then
But it’s not interesting in the sense that Zoro said “they” which could imply they knew he was multiple people or whatever
Coz that’s not true
Really?
Stoopid, you believe they could sense multiple people from him back in Jaya?
I don’t even think that’s something a master in observation would be able to decipher lol, especially not pre ts Zoro and Luffy
Lmao
That’s not the point Stoopid
Intent and hostility is different from sensing whether a person has multiple souls or whatever
Especially since Zoro was the one to say if
I don’t think it’s even a matter of observation haki lmao
Exactly
Surely all the top tiers at MF
Would be able to sense it
Zoro and Luffy on jaya were literally referring to the BB crew
And how they are dangerous as a collective
What?
That’s not the reason
^
That’s such a redundant thing to say. Obvious things without official confirmation can’t be claimed as wrong hurdur
Like come on
Fine, if I say I’m 99% confident that it’s referring to the crew, but not 100% does that make you happy
Fine I’m 98% certain
This is what annoys me. Bring something that can make the idea of “it was referring to the crew” not sound like the only possibility. In stead of just saying “ItS yOuR iNtErPrEtAtIoN” but technically not a fact. Coz I hate when the discussion can’t progress
Idk It’s not eve 7 am and I need a coffee. Maybe then I’ll be more personable
<:sadge:728308757964128346>
OK but...
I think you all missed what I was trying to say in the first place
But w/e
You just took me saying my interpretation as me stating a fact and thereby denouncing yours. Which isn’t the case. This wasn’t the type of discussion where I was correcting a misinformed fact. It was a discussion of hypotheticals where I just gave my interpretation. I wasn’t calling you objectively incorrect, or myself objectively correct. I know I used hyperbole so sorry if it came off that way.
Cerberus fruit <a:PepePuke:654218964162838538>
Lol
Wdym
Will Burgess just get a fucking fruit already my god
<:SengokuPalm:701663557338529802>
I’m not even gonna
Lol
There is clear favouritism at play here and I don’t like it
<:Uso:637751966184767546>
Lol I claim an idea as almost “dumb” even tho I never said that. But the second Doom and Choc denounce it no one brings it up lmao
<:Uso:637751966184767546>
Favouritism
That was hyperbole anyway
But do the same for others plz
Me (as hyperbole)
But then Doom called it stupid as well
Never said anything
I’m too tired and hungry
Sorry bout this
I don’t really care ngl
That is what I was doing
And I didn’t call the idea not true
I was referring to the idea that Zoro and Luffy somehow had this special type of observation haki “not true” especially pre ts
It isn’t interesting lmao
So I was being honest
Stoopid. You don’t need to write a fucking essay each message just to denounce my “poor” choice words as this mighty sin I committed against the laws of discussion. Especially since this is over text. And it was quite an innocent discussion to begin with
Too early for that shit
Again. I think me using this emote <:Uso:637751966184767546> implied that it was facetious
Ok Jojos part 2 is much much better than part 1
Might actually make me continue the series lmao
If I watch Eva first, then can I watch Jojos Frost?
I don’t even know. You said “kills you” so I assumed that was in reference to me watching Jojos
I’m not really with it this morning
I assume you’re joking when you said “Kuro’s fruit”
That’s coz Kyros is the chaddiest of chads
Sorry for being mean part 1

Not super long, but it was getting there

Just feed him misinformation
Tell his impatient ass to wait and find out <:LUL:321931602655707136> <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Lmao

<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
I have red in my hair. You can really see it in the sun
It’s really weird
Lot of gingers on my moms side
Sounds like a bargain
<:ApooPoint:714023366356500531>
Wait brb
Lol at the barbers she was like “so what have you been doing for fun during quarantine”
And I was like, how can I say something that isn’t “I’ve been sitting on my fatass reading manga and using discord all day for the past 3 months”
So I just said “I’ve been going for runs”
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
I have mastered the art of bullshit
Had to make myself sound slightly respectable
Same
Lmao
So antisocial
Part of their training as well
I should make my own barbershop called “haircuts for antisocial weebs who don’t want to talk”
I would make millions
How many chapters is shaman king?
I know this may sound dumb, but is there anything that it’s “similar” to
Coz I have no idea what it’s about and I keep hearing about it
I see
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
Weird
I literally just had chipotle
Is Doen being a DOEgenerate again?
Get it
Like Doen
But degenerate
<a:aPES_Laugh:664885767574781964>
Let me scroll up
Garp low diffs Roger on a drizzly Tuesday
No
Break
is this about the storm during the ed war?
It was Scopper Gaban
mark my words
yes
Pasta <:Uso:637751966184767546>
Scopper is the shipwright of the Roger Pirates
more relevant than Luffy
lol what if he doesn't like it
that would be funny
oh right
didn't like his Thriller Bark review
yeh
the summit war saga is perfection so I can see why it keeps getting better for him
sabaody, Impel Down, and MF are all 10/10 arcs for me
so I get where he's coming from
Sabaody is definitely a 10, Impel Down may be a 9 but still close
does he know about Ace?
I don't really watch him too often
so idk
lol
based on his dislikes from Thriller Bark. There are things of Dressrosa that I don't think he'll like
but he might still like it as a whole
the nosebleed stuff in FMI might piss him off as well
yeh
he completely disregarded Moria's intent as a character yeh. Idk if he just didn't mention it in the script, but he focused **way **too much on his powers I agree
I think he overreacted to the Absalom stuff as well. I know it is weird for a lot of people, but not to the point where it detracts from the arc imo
as a whole
Dressrosa maybe  but there are aspects of Dressrosa I don't think he'll enjoy
I hope he likes WCI. I just don't want him to be super distracted by superficial "flaws" that become infinitely better after a reread or more consideration
I know it's meant to be his first read through
whatever people seem to complain about at first glance Kaz
Wano is gonna be better than WCI 100%
> arlong arc is the best arc :) <@!426750321893703683> **YES BOYS**. I found another
welcome to the Arlong gang
when Wano is done, and you can binge it. It will be amazing for sure
soon
Dressrosa is 10x as good now that you can binge it
it's far from perfect Illu
but I really disliked it weekly
hell
like, terrible
I haven't reread Thriller Bark in probably a good 2 years
goddam
need to reread it soon
lol didn't he apologize on twitter or something from ~~fan correction~~
aslkfj
and fuck now I have the hiccups
yeh Arsal
I get that it's his first read through and is meant to be his raw thoughts. But like, especially as the story gets grander in scale, he should really take more time to think over stuff
he's too weak
are you caught up?
YC, there is a guy in <#164970986284777473> I keep thinking is you, coz he's purple and has a capital Y and C in his name
go trademark your name
<:LULW:607641487429206106>

<:SaboEvil:705903442995970058>
I miss my hair
<a:GutsMegaCry:721314623495733288>
all it takes is a 400 IQ sea king and the marines are fucked
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
Why didn't I think of that Zyph
<:CrocoDurr:663850964763279381>
brb, gonna go get my hair back
LMAO
YC
The other guy is gonna be so confused lmao
he's gonna lose another
probably won't find out for another year or so
but he will
virus
<a:aPES_Hacker:513527552976093204>
Youss rn
now that's a man
hoo rah
leg hair and bear kills as infants are the only true accurate scales of power
in one piece
yep
unless Shanks is revealed to have killed many bears as a toddler, Oden is objectively the strongest character in the series
yeh but no leg hair
at least
I hope not
was this carrot croco shit added recently?
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME
<a:REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEGIF:393866924192432158>
<@!248949219564584962> his bet was I think whether the scabbards would wound Kaido or not. And my bet with him is whether Kaido will die or not
not only is it another damn crocokid emote
**BUT A FURRY CROCOKID EMOTE**
the world has lost it's balanced
Grizz has worked hard on this emote
and we end up getting another shitty croco kid
No
we need it
time to protest
reactions are generally annoying anyway lmao
especially when spammed
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
wait and post war arc?
damn
that's a lot of material
50 minutes, I don't have the attention span for that
This might motivate me to finally do a MF reread
been too long
(6 months)
lol
imagine reading in the first place
I could reread MF in a day
30 chapters
actually
yeppers
550-580
no
You could say MF had buildup since Alabasta
I guess yeg
Hail the Punch of Pasta. He truly is a one piece deity
Wano has been built up since TB
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
damn
he beat me
well it hasn't been built up, just mentioned in TB
yep
?
no
Toei have shown to be really good at adapting as little of a chapter as possible I think they'll be just fine <:LULW:607641487429206106>
> Toei can adapt one panel to a full episode <@!642442486140370944> They probably could which is the sad part <:LULW:607641487429206106> at least 1 page
epic panel
The scabbards are such a good addition to the story
fucking love them
concrete evidence as to why Franky is the worst SH
right here
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
