What's different, bean?
Personally: "Get the weapons" is more rough-fodder-like than "arm yourselves"

here Bean
Middle
It's a detail tho
And that translation removes the "Oden's Ryuo" part, doesn't it? Now I gotta check the raw
> And that translation removes the "Oden's Ryuo" part, doesn't it? Now I gotta check the raw <@!415999229564157955> The raw says "Koitsura mo Oden no Ryuo wo?" So not having "Oden's ryuo" in the translationis kinda wrong there. He's saying smth like "These guys also have Oden's Ryuo?"
Unless I'm wrong and Oden can mean somthing else than Oden

Lame chat
It'll be an avalanche of sulongs
I predict minks climbing Kaido like they're some crazy mfs
It does
That's how he flies
D: When Kaido turned into a dragon, did he like float in the air?  O: Heard dragons can fly in the sky by using the clouds, so Kaido's doing that by generating his own clouds and then walking from cloud to cloud. Does that make sense?
Volume 93
Oh
Bean, the super human
It should be musketeers and guardians, no? The mink army. We see the giraffe, so i assume he's the guardian giraffe
Oh minks already saw the moon, no Oda, nooo

What guy?
Never said I was a mod
You're too dumb for this conversation
Imagine not wanting people to get spoiled in other series
> They were just talking  about the concept of death <@!345807250109235201> using examples from other series lol
They did
> ||The actual reason I dislike dragonball, is actually because death means nothing lmao|| <@!345807250109235201> Tell me how this isn't getting into the specifics of how deaths work in this series.
Just did
In other series
That's a spoiler in itself lol
You're changing perception of a series
Yes, using other series examples is not allowed
You can just say "if people died all the time..."
> Not spoilers at all <@!345807250109235201> All the mods will disagree.
> People die in every series <@!345807250109235201> Not in every. Also, you said how they are meaningless in that series. When someone sees a death there, they will have their perception changed by what you said. Therefore, it spoiled the series
Then you're wrong and it's done
> Or did he really expect to save ace with all his crew without anuone dying <@!220515768897372160> It's about consent
Ramon, this is not about utilitarianism. If they decide to risk their lives to save a fellow crewmate and family member, they're doing it on their own
They're also pirates and warriors
> U think they can save ace without anyone dying? <@!220515768897372160> They decided to die
You're saying it's not the utilitarian way, but it never is when someone risks their life in a war
A war that is just a battle tho
> That‚Äôs like saying  anyone who signs up for the military ‚Äúdecides to die‚Äù <@!345807250109235201> They decide to risk their lives. Though yeah, poorly worded

Punching hurts, she is being smart
He didn't ruin Kanjuro, what do you mean?
I don't think so. What was bad specifically
Orochi thought that as long as he has the leader of the rebels (Momonosuke), Kanjuro can stop the act. It shows Orochi was too confident and that Kanjuro just really follows what Orochi says
Stop discussing the discussion u two. Ramon, I showed my interpretation, what do you see that counters it?
He thought he had all the cards
And getting Momo
Orochi was always that guy that, as soon as he sees he has an upper hand, he is blinded by delusions of victory. If he had doubted himself, he could've used his cards better
I don't use stupid as an insult. No reason
<:NamiFlush:625741106193367054>
In the end Orochi got what he wanted, yeah, I guess
The death was independent from the plans

How is it unlawful if he got to write the laws
> Is this a random Drawing or is Oda hinting some kind of affinity between Franky and Robin? <@!194504958249402368> Only if your head wants to
Haki does not nulify a DF power, it makes DF users show their true bodies
Ryuo means haki bro
Easier but wrong is not cool
Normal
Wano gave armament that name due to their theory of it having to flow to one place of the body
I say levely
Saying levely and reverie is still referring to the same thing. Eliminating Ryuo=Haki from the equation is changing the meaning of the word
Everyone getting something wrong doesn't make it right
What is right is dictated by the story, not by democracy

> this is a plot hole right ? <@!690158729685106749> Why?
Kaido tried to get info from the scabbards, u can just look at how Kaido says "oh they didn't really know anything" when he knows about Kanjuro
> zoro asks "why was your boss executed" and kinemon says "because he went to raftel with roger" <@!171861037438599169> You're simplifying the page. Go by steps to show why that's the interpretation
That's another interpretation, yeah
That's on u. Not the point of the discussion
> Ninjas are opposed to be epic, why is raizo so goofy üò° <@!206896898215378945> We reading the same series?
I quite like that One Piece thing
~~üíó
> I was 100% correct when i said the Scabbards did not have enough story/hype behind them <@!550837342517067786> reread pls
> yet their motivations were only fleshed out these last couple chapters <@!550837342517067786> Nah, u need to reread
> At least one <@!164215302689783811> Well, yes, but I'll go as far as to say at least two
<:KikuTriggered:638344544286408767>
Raizo even trimmed his beard there
Between 986 and 987, Raizo is like this: has no sword; has sword; has no sword and making ninjutsu hand sign; has a sword; has two swords.  MF has a sword summoning jutsu for sure
Yes, Robin had 100% development when she joined. <:ShanksYes:727411684095819856>   (More than Yamato for sure, but she still has time for it)
> Do they use haki for it? <@!306372168827273216> It's ninjutsu bro. Ninja arts. That's it. Oda also doesn't explain Hasshoken too much for example
How much more?
> Yamato definitely had a more memorable first appearance than nami <@!698761447835959337> Oh u saying u don't remember Nami pretending to be ill and then stealing the boat and treasure from the three Buggy pirates that Zoro fought later, leaving them with a storm that made them shipwreck? LOL POSER
> Yamato has nothing too interesting going on besides her being Kaidos daughter/son <@!550837342517067786> Ace? Personality?
> <@!415999229564157955>  I don‚Äôt tbh <@!564773067969265674> Yeah, I remember, but I'm joking, as it isn't a special moment at all for a first appearance
> and Ace is meh so far <@!550837342517067786> So out of all the interesting parts of Yamato in the last few chapters she appeared in, you dismiss them all and then say she has no memorable first appearance or any development (or in this case exploration of her persoality)?
It's like saying "if we ignore all the things that make Yamato not Nami, she is Nami"
> to get into the lacking f Yamato i would have to type out a paragraph in an active chat <@!550837342517067786> "I have no argument, therefore I'll say it would be too big". Give us a glimpse
> what would Yamato add to the crew? <@!550837342517067786> You were the one making the claims, now you want our claims to dismiss yours? Counter the arguments dude.
Like Luffy cares about roles if he isn't in need of more lol
> that is why all members have an arc BEFORE they join the crew <@!550837342517067786> Zoro joined after a quick fight with Morgan, if u consider that an arc. Nami joined before Arlong. Robin joined before her arc, EL (Alabasta was a little bit of her character).
It's about who they are, not *just* what they bring
> What is Yamato to Luffy right now? <@!550837342517067786> Yamato exists since the past month irl bro
> u did nopt tell me what Yamato brings because she brings nothing as of right now <@!550837342517067786> Do the Straw Hats need to bring something to the crew, or is this your headcanon that they need some role?
Then if Luffy wants Yamato to join, he'll have her join. If it is ultimatey what Luffy wants, then your argument is not strong
> Vivi was just an affiliate rather than a nakama <@!711869066142416936> She is a honorary member of the crew
> <@!703504844903940096> 1. Did he ever actually join. > 2. Did they have an established relationship when Luffy asked him to join <@!550837342517067786> Did Brook have?
For 2
Oh Brook had a relationship with Luffy when he asked to join him, 30 seconds after Luffy meets him. <:ShanksYes:727411684095819856>
Thank you for what? Oda does the picking, then Oda can pick Yamato bro

Oh yes abuse deserves death, how civilised we are today
Akainu is a genral of the dictators
The dictators are Im, Gorosei and the other celestial pests
> He even has his own goddamn secret military force <@!683663101186277416> He doesn't?
But the dictators are Im and Gorosei, bro
Akainu is a tool

Smoker leads a marine base that burns pirates lol
> Yes and he actively practices that while even going against the gorosei his commanders at times <@!683663101186277416> When did he go against the gorosei?
Then he is still a tool
For the actual dictators
He does
Sengoku sent Saul to fuck Ohara up
> Sengoku started the war with Whitebeard <@!340565781806972942> War is war. However, he did order a person to be executed due to their father being the pirate king. Shitty af
Killing by association, eugenics. Sengoku was shitty too
Nah he says his bloodline should not exist
> What no he had ace executed cause he was the 2nd comander of wb pirates <@!276525516302057486>

Dude, stop. He didn't want to continue the war
I'd love if Shanks crew did like a haka or some tribal war cries when their ship is approaching an enemy ship, then the sky is like black above them and the enemy only gets to hear from a distance and then see some crazy dudes with tongues out and hitting their weapons against each other, against themselves, against the ship to make that crazy mf sound while staring at the enemy. My headcanon is sick
Man that image of Shanks crew needs to be real
Oda pls
> Is zoro confirmed shimotsuki <@!564773067969265674> He's confirmed Roronoa
!loro3
Yeah we don't. We know he was in Shimotsuki village and that he was a pretty difficult kid to deal with
But new info about past doesn't need to come in flashbacks
> sanjis backstory was so cold and zoros was just his friend dying from stairs <@!231759510014918656> "just", get youself together bro
> How is it realistic? Only unborn children die from stairs <@!564773067969265674> You clearly have no knowledge about this
People die from stairs all the time
Plus, "falling down the stairs" might also mean "suicide", it's an expression in japan iirc
> <@!509083474955599874>  I fell from the top of high stairs in second grade right on my face and I‚Äôm still here <@!564773067969265674> Anecdotal evidence is not good evidence. Thousands die from falling from stairs. It's how you fall and what may have been damaged. Don't just mock victims by saying only "unborn children" die from stairs.
> <@!415999229564157955>  ik zoros backstory was sad as well but when u compare the two <@!231759510014918656> Why would you feel the need to compare them, though?
Are you young?
Because that's something I'd say when I was like 7
If you can't understand simple anatomy, I can't help you
Being part of the buggy pirates says nothing. Saying the shit they said tells us about their age and/or pure ignorance
Malicious ignorance, even, saying some people deserve to die
<#456573949120217089> Learn the rules before saying shit
You saying people deserve to die because they are weak
I am. People die from this shit. I study at the hospital, I won't just mock victims of physical trauma
Sure.
!jazz suggest <MipAli #6357 - if this dude can just say people deserve to die if they fall from stairs because they're weak, joking or not, and stay without a warning or a mute for it, rules 2 and 4 matter not on this server.>
Yall really wanting Boa to lose
Hm why?
She doesn't have to lose this battle, though. The system is down right now
> what would she do if she won <@!509083474955599874> Continue being the pirate empress
Boa Marigold knows advanced armament. Boa Hancock has all three types. Amazon Lily is a land of warriors
Doesn't need it, but having someone in their ranks who has it is big
Boa can win against Koby all day. I can imagine possibilities of him winning, sure. I don't think he is affected by her sexyness, as he's already seen the sexiest in the world, Alvida
> I wonder if Kobe a simp or if the marines disciplined him enough <@!611703107231154190> When he thinks of "beauty", he thinks of getting fucked up by a certain cub
> koby is only a simp for Luffy <@!521427565492305931> The battle of Luffy's lovers
The hardest, most fiery love wins
I can't see those dudes winning against Amazon Lily and Kuja Pirates without *something* new. Seems like the match is really unfair now
Those mfs need to start putting stuff in the papers
I swear

Question "What's the arc named Thriller Bark?"
Thriller Bark saga lowkey pre-Camie Saga
It's the saga before Camie Saga
There's Pre-pro-Camie Saga, Pro-Camie Saga, Pre-Camie Saga, Camie Saga, Post-Camie Saga, Post-post-Camie Saga (current)
> all arcs build up to thriller bark even Wano <@!521427565492305931> With Moria and the actual Thriller Bark appearing in the "Wano saga", you're not wrong
How the fuck did Moria get Thriller Bark to go through the Red Line to get to the New World
> if you can‚Äôt go under the redline go over it <@!521427565492305931> To go over u need permission from the WG tho... Unless Moria went on the side like a boss
Moria used balloons to cross the Red Line. Great theory
Nah, they Neko's
Inuarashi has musketeers
I think we see the black cat and the giraffe musketeers

> only admiral i've seen anything related to wano would be sakazuki with his flower tattoos that are super similar to old man hyogoro or whatever <@!112963866589147136> Fujitora's kimono
And sword shit
> can‚Äôt wait to see odens flashback stretched for 10000 episodes <@!231759510014918656> Hopefully
WB saying his heart got hurt when his kids' daddy left him
We getting an episode letsa go
You can in various ways, tho unethical
Nah mate
Too dangerous to medicate bro
Yeah but BM for nakama
> like what <@!123129548752551937> Sharing food when she loses her memory <:FranKEKer:635609882438926376>
BM aint about them eugenics
BM wants diversity so much she kidnapped men to have kids and them got rid of them
Basically meaning forcing men to make kids
Not good lol
She'd be a serial sexual criminal irl
> I would totally live in tottland if I were in the op world, sure there‚Äôs a small lifespan tax but the quality of life is worth it imo <@!345807250109235201> Just don't be a strange race to BM tho
> SHE ATE HER MOM <@!606196171307745308> Not with malicious intent
Now kidnapping and forcing husbands to make kids she did with such intentions
She's evil for sure
That's a great face
I like how quick it is
Hiyori is a chad
> Ok I‚Äôm in ep 7 I think? Every character with the exception of buggy is hot <@!190654961934270465> LOL haha
Zoro, the role model
Solid ship
otoko is not otoko tho
> this picture reminds me of perona <@!231759510014918656> Yeah I can see some lowkey Perona vibes
But I love the colours these last eps
> I mean every one piece girl does look the same tbh lmao <@!286343745077510145> Wrong
They are all different
Or mostly all different
Bro continue watching
you'll like it
Maybe in <#714694214855819344> you can talk without getting spoiled tho
Read the rules
Of that channel ahah
Oh that's fine. But you'll get spoiled
Luffy is with Hyo <:BuggySweat:704463253819883611>
Hiyoro
This dude isn't ok
Ah
Does that have spoilers?
Yeah it does
Hyo is describing haki
It's in the past
Animation is amazing
And I love love love Wano's colours
> ~~bonchan?~~ <@!445046828824789002> Bon Kurei is now the Queen of Newkamaland, level 5.5. However, Newkama is a culture of people who transcend gender because they've tried all of it. So for someone to be the Queen, it would make sense for them to be able to grant such wishes, like Iva did with his hormones. That's why I'd love if Oda said that Bon Kurei awakened his DF and can now transform others
New Chopper>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
It wasnt
Monster Point is cooler now bc it lets him say stuff like this
>  > <@!171861037438599169> where did it even come from other than his flag having that design > <@!289876647354826752> Maybe characters talking about his body being strange and Luffy and Zoro saying it's "them" - possibly meaning Teach and his crew but another interpretation is that BB is more than one person in some way
AnM
Jinbe is just jumping from party to party - Party in FMI, WCI's wedding, the party with the fish-men after WCI, the party after Wano
Koby dying too
Good thing u ain't the writer bro
> It seems like regular armament but he was deflected due to basic logic <@!564773067969265674> It's advanced
Well the party was after they treated the wounded
The admirals just didn't care
Gaben, don't help that person derail the convo
> Would Koby not care about beauty and stuff like Luffy or he would react like a normal human <@!363700749370261514> MF lived two years of his childhood having to say an ogre is the most beautiful woman, so one can only assume the consequences ~~Sanji~~
> Minks aren‚Äôt attracted to humans right <@!564773067969265674> Who knows
OHHHH
Yeah
yes
She can just use her super mega powerful Haoshoku
> i mean all the minks are with them?? <@!581506999657955367> The mink warriors
I don't think there's any mink children there
> There‚Äôs probably more to coc <@!564773067969265674> What we know now: - Bang bang bangs weak af mfs that wouldn't even be worth fighting - Skilled playas can pick who they choose to spare - A skilled playa could fuck a cool boat
> Do you think the sulong forms would look savage or like elegant like carrot <@!662544074015899649> We've seen both
If they're all white with red eyes and motherfuckerly, I accept either way
Carrot Sulong again will fight with the SH and be part of the crew
Inu is calm, meaning he doesn't use all of his motherfuckerness and anger, so he'll use it all now <:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
Neko is always using it
They've been presented as equal
she looks amazing
I'm a manga elitist, ama
no
I refuse that description
> why are you mad when the anime adds one pixel that isnt in the manga? <@!198930928083402753> imagine really thinking like that
Who on earth would say that Toko saying she wants to see a kappa and then laughing is a bad addition?
yall ger Ririka in the first episodes lol
Ririka is Rika's mother u dumb dumbs
Posers
Reread
I got into OP bc some friends kinda liked it. Now I like it more than them
I bought my first figure in the first day of watching
lol that print
I never thought OP was trash because I'm not someone who judges shit without actually understanding it. You wouldn't understand
> but i forgot everything the next day <@!509083474955599874> Me in every exam
I loved biochem
Biochemistry is really cool
> Biochemistry from my experience is lots of memorisation but it is very interesting <@!662544074015899649> Well you gotta know the pathways, so if you understand those it becomes more logical than memory
What's your problem? Creating problems where they don't exist
I lived in less than 197
How much do yall think Kaido weighs?
in numbers
Also how high do yall think he was at the live stage
> 800 pounds maybe <@!407999944675295265> International system units pls
> 100KGs <@!198930928083402753> That's a fat human
> i was not expecting a full moon lol <@!497725914369490996> They planned it to be a full moon since the beginning
Oh the sulong
yeah
LOL its that even a match?
> In the anime ..kaido was still drunk when hitting luffy. And he sobered up when said luffy still angry at him unconsciously. Even when leaving, he said, he's going back get more drunk. (I suppose that's not canon.<@!407999944675295265> <@!736943713439449099> That is canon
Kaido says he aint getting Law bc he was sober and wanted to drink
> Wasn‚Äôt bear guy in the background in the manga <@!564773067969265674> Nah, there was a bear gifter but he looked different. So we can't make a clear connection
The bear gifter had a human head inside his mouth, but his bear part was bear like and not plush like
Pretty cool Oda
> Because someone insisted CP0 was a bad and dangerous job when it's probably the second or third highest position in the world? It's both those things. A dangerous and powerful position. However, how can they be the second or third if there's Im, Gorosei, rest of CDs and Kong above them? That's like the fifth pfft
Maybe it will be about apple consumption. Speculation power
> why isnt spandam dead <@!375397668727291911> The power of OP medicine
> i dont remember wapol being beheaded <@!375397668727291911> Reread
Eggs come out of the cloaca
<:NotLikeMomo:740778600025817110>
When does Roger have it in the flashback?
Shanks going back to get the Poneglyph would make sense. He could've been guarding Laugh Tale that way
How many Poneglyphs does the WG have tho?
Even if they can't read them
Pluton is just a nice ship
How does Poseidon help create the red line? Make the sea creatures work?
The Red Line too big for giants tho
Well we see big whales blocking currents before, big creatures can do it no prob
> kaido could just one shot each sea king one by one from the sky <@!289876647354826752> Bro u know how many there are and what they are?
Sea Kings are highly intelligent, they don't need to kill everything they see
Evidence is that that's the weapon with the power to destroy the world
Are there only 1000 sea kings?
Or is this speculation the damage of 1000 sea kings?
Small sea kings are sea kings
But a lot of big ass ones are crazy
Oh but those big ones are the same, aren't they?
It's interesting that those are the same we see in the Calm Belt
These dudes eat sea kings
Sea kings are really diverse - that's the conclusion
Zunesha looks something like this, from OP Magazine
Sea Kings are fast. Zunesha is slow in comparison too
But if Sea Kings don't attack Zunesha it's for a reason, no?
Sea Kings also don't attack the Kuja snakes
The big ones
<#522036834310815744>
Yeah, and Zunesha could have a tough skin <:FranKEKer:635609882438926376>
