I got the big ol mute last night
it was fun
||Fucking Tendo is just making chocolate in Paris. I was honestly not that surprised|| Haikyuu manga ending
I wasn't spoiled at all
And I'm glad
Berserk
Wait smile
I'm on chapter 100 or so
Istg if you overtake me tonight
LMAO
wait King, where are you in
like which part
I see
||Is S4 pt 2 just gonna be the Inarizaki match similar to S3|| Haikyuu S4 pt 2 DONT OPEN KING
oh nice
I gave it a 10, and I gave OP a 10
so they're both amazing
yeh Hog, that's what I was thinking
no I gave the Haikyuu manga a 10
The problem with that lol, is that S4 was still amazing, we're just comparing it to the previous 3 seasons which were all near perfect
lol
OST was shit compared to the previous 3 seasons imo
||I can't believe Tanaka and Shimizu are married. I mean, I guess it makes sense.|| Haikyuu manga ending. Don't open King
Good point
<:AkainuSweat:586408945137090571>
I'm actually doing really well with avoiding spoilers for certain series
Like I knew absolutely zero Haikyuu spoilers
Don't know any Berserk spoilers
feelin good
where are you reading it smile?
you should really download the MEGA link that's pinned here
read it King
it's amazing
you should really consider downloading the link that's pinned here
Archer's my go to source if I have a Berserk question lol
I mean he runs the discord
Actually, knowing him, he'll just say "yes, I like it"
LMAO
yes
very good
I'm not even finished lol
361
first 16 or so are 50 pages long, so I guess you could count them as 2
yeh, most are 20 pages
yeh
AoT is monthly so its longer
it legit took me 20 minutes to read the letter chapters
you're being interrogated
Is Re:Zero worth watching?
Gust?
neither
lol
Guts
I only ask about Re: Zero coz I keep seeing this damn blue haired girl in a maid outfit everywhere I look
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
yeh her
I would really slow down with Berserk
there are some spreads that you can't just gloss over imo
yeh
imo at least
yeh
yhe Miura
Miura's combat style is also better imo
the way he draws fight scenes
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
Lol, Miura is a far more proficient combatant than Murata
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
Berserk sucks hard Will
I agree that Murata's art feels more "robotic"
that's a good point
OPM chapter 58, ||this spread is objectively amazing, but there's something about Miura's spreads that I just find more impactful||
I've rewatched S1 so many times its insane
so rewatchable
OPM s1 is actually hilarious
> opm season 1 is very not hilarious <@!496362640688283649> that's coz your sense of humor is restricted to Buggy D Clown jokes
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
is this S1 Rob?
I wouldn't ask people powerscaling questions on here. It's purely subjective. The only people who have the answers are Oda and myself <@!731646434658615316>
I prefer Saitama to Mob in almost every way, but I understand people preferring Mob
I choose to ignore titles in OP, coz it leads it just leads to confusion and overanalyzing
<#522036834310815744>
I mean Choc, can Zoro truly call himself the worlds greatest swordsman if he doesn't beat everyone who has ever picked up a sword??
So am I
lol
I've come to understand Choc's humor very well dw Wow
damn
idk why, I just never got hooked on Mob as much as a lot of people die
still really enjoy it
Buggy isn't annoying, Buggy jokes are annoying
are you still reading on mobile?
omg ur going too fast smile those chapters took me 20 minutes each to read I know I can't speak for everyone but hot damn
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
how many chapters is slam dunk?
ok, so not as long as Haikyuu
what are you rating it Mai?
outta 10
that's how I feel about Haikyuu atm
but I don't think I'm gonna change it
I'm gonna read AnJ before Slam Dunk tho
I'm assuming it's high school basketball right?
||were they like Ennoshita, Kinoshita, and Karita levels of irrelevancy <:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045> ? || Haikyuu and Slam Dunk
damn
you prefer SD to Haikyuu Juba?
how can someone's opinion on a fictional series be disrespectful?
7 is still good
for me
I would only give 10s to things I consider practically flawless
I only have two 10s so far
granted my list is smaller than most
but still
yeh Cho, I see you only have two 10s as well
oh right, I was looking at ur manga list
oh shit, I didn't scroll down enough
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
(ghost stories)
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
I would be really concerned if it wasn't lol
<:NICEFUCKINSHIT:605709924395122720>
this is my note for haikyuu on anilist lol
I can totally see that Mai
I pretty much rely on some of the people on here's recommendations lmao
is chihayafaru still ongoing?
||Like for instance, you could say, Griffith decided to become Femto due to his childhood ambition/dream, coupled with the trauma he faced during his torture. But did the IoE manipulate cause and effect to where Griffith had sex with Charlotte, was found out, then tortured. Like, were those events destined to happen so that things would eventually lead to Griffith making the choice during the eclipse? Is everything not 100% certain to happen, or are some things certain so that it can lead to eventual "choices". I'm just kinda confused on how much actual free will people have in Berserk.|| Berserk 94
Ooh Ok, that makes a lot more sense
thanks for being patient with my retardation Archer
really appreciate it
some people on the other server have told me they prefer conviction to golden age
so I'm just really in the Berserk "mode" rn
||but there are like mini "sub-arcs" in the grand scheme of the conviction arc right? Like I'm on the lost children "sub-arc"|| Berserk Conviction arc
yeh, that makes sense
smile omg, ur legit gonna overtake me in the space of a couple of hours
yeh, that's what I figured
oh ok
hmmmm
interesting
ngl, Berserk memes are funny af
or edgy I guess
but still funny
I hate that a few have made me laugh, even tho I know they're mostly sick
yes
||I hate the Donovan memes||
but there are others that I've seen on different subjects
that have made me laugh
yep
I find the idol master memes kinda funny
||is that why berserklejerk exists?||
for all the degenerates
wdym, on this server, or other channels
it is kinda weird how thats the thing that is most memed about
||Donovan||
wait smile
is that ch 30 after the letter chapters???!!!
or episode
rather
WTF??
||lol, I love how you guys have a role for people who correctly guess when a chapter will drop|| Archer
and you ofc have it
you genius
||Also, I'm pretty sure skull knight mentioned this. But that "child" Casca gave birth to, that's Guts' not Griffith's right?|| Berserk 94
<:WapolTriggered:587621943725916180>
blasphemy
I see
||was kinda pissed when Casca lost her memories, but I'm sure it will work out as read further|| Berserk 94 don't open smile
ok I have to keep reading, smile I think you will actually overtake me
ippo and jojos
lol
Good
Lmao Cho
I'm so mixed on whether I should actually read Jojo
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
I'm like halfway through part 2
but I watch maybe 1 episode a week lol
um ... it's better than part 1 definitely
I'm enjoying it
but it's not amazing
yeh I like Joseph
it's more if I'm willing to commit to it before/over other series I want to watch
and read
oh, no doubt in my mind I will prefer Berserk over Jojos lol
I'm loving Gintama as well
I've watch probably 40 episodes over the course of 2 years
but I really like it
when you're practically an anime/manga virgin
life's tough
Archer can I tell you something
I watched all of the 97 adaptation in dub on youtube the other day
and started watching 2016
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
dw I stopped
||she's reading in the time chamber from dragon ball|| db
||who's being tortured?|| Berserk 38 smile
HOW ARE YOU READING THIS FAST ON MOBILE???????
what is going on
||isn't that later?|| Berserk
yeh that's not right
wait
really?
||wait so he's already burned the queen in the tower?|| Berserk 38 I guess
I'm convinced you have super powers smile
<:WapolTriggered:587621943725916180>
what season??
my favorite
enjoy
<:ok_Griff:452942412579471411>
very nice
||I prefer her way over whoever plays Britta can't remember her name|| Archer
but that's western series so I'll drop it
I finished this morning Shimon
<:ZeusShit:396351094483058689>
ummmmmm
I think I'll still say one piece
but I gave haikyuu a 10
so
YAY
me and Shimon
the funny thing is
Shimon asked to be muted
Red just muted me
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
nooo, when he caught me in general, I was literally back from getting a snack from the fridge, then I just wanted to say hi
but nope
<:UsoppBan:639600917070610442>
nah it was funny
all good
and to be absolutely fair to Red
I most likely would not have finished if he didn't mute me
LOL
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
maybe I need to do that with every series I read
just mute me the whole time til I finish
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
mute me til I finish every series ever
not if I don't read the series coz I keep getting distracted
lol
I have the attention span of a mongoose
||oooh just realized this is the bitch who was there when skull knight saved rickert that one time|| Berserk 100
yeh
||I was just saying this on the berserk server, I only just realized as well that it was the count who "killed" Pippin, but I did realize that the succubus || Berserk 100
Haikyuu manga ending||I kinda knew they were going to lose. But the way it was executed was perfect. Me and Mai were talking earlier, but Takeda's speech to Hinata was so powerful. Perfect end to the tournament arc. Kenma giving Shoyo the iPad was so awesome. I'm glad they are such great friends even though they are completely opposite personalities. The Brazil stuff was great, loved seeing Oikawa, but I think the Jackals vs Adlers match was pretty much a flawless ending. Everything about it was just amazing. I too had that "theory" that the second manga the little wants to start is "Haikyuu", probably not but would be cool. All the characters had a super satisfying, believable, and fitting ending and practically all their arcs came full circle. Furudate is actually one of the best character writers I've read in manga so far, and that's not even including how well they write the actual volleyball aspect of the story. This manga is an easy 10/10. I'm already thinking of rewatching/rereading soon.||
||oh yeah, and him telling Hoshiumi he can be the little giant coz he decided the greatest decoy was better for him was easily a top 10 moment for me in the series|| Haikyuu manga ending
> haikyuu manga ending spoilers ||I'm sure 99.99% of people didn't expect the timeskip. Glad you loved it all though, some people are really offput by it|| <@!377670308280139784> Really???
I loved every second of it
I thought it was practically flawless
<:NICEFUCKINSHIT:605709924395122720>
||did they want to see another year at Karasuno, without Daichi, Suga, and Asahi? I'm glad that didn't happen, and I think the way the tournament ended for them was perfect|| Haikyuu 402
me too
||I'm also glad that the team that won the tournament was a team I don't think we ever heard of or seen any players from. It made the idea that the tournament was the be all end all. The national team coach said it best where there is always gonna be a team better than you, and it's impossible to win them all. Karasuno didn't have to win to prove that they were a top team in the nation, nor did they have to win for Shoyo, Kageyama, and Tsukki to all become pros.|| haikyuu 402
||| I  think that's kinda stupid ngl. What did they expect? Another 800 chapters? with each interval losing core members of the cast. I'm so glad we got what we got.|| Haikyuu 402 mai
||maybe a mini arc or something showing his 2nd and 3rd years, but even that I think isn't really needed?|| Haikyuu 402
||this may just be recency bias and I need more time to absorb, but I think the ending was perfect|| Haikyuu 402
I'm really surprised by that ngl
||I just found the transition to the ts super refreshing. In a battle shonen or something, you know the good guys are gonna win and save the world or w/e. But here, I found the ending of the tournament fulfilling. I enjoyed Haikyuu for the characters more than anything. What would showing Hinata's other years which would probably be very similar do? And it's not like the content of the ts was disappointing. It was perfect and felt earned. idk that's just my take|| Haikyuu 402
||I would go off on that argument. Imo, that's really idiotic and trust me, in hindsight, if they got that, they'd probably end up complaining that Haikyuu "isn't what it used to be" or is getting "too repetitive".|| Haikyuu 402 mai
||I'm actually really surprised by that, so were some people genuinely "upset" by the ending. Or dissatisfied? I mean to each their own I just find that really surprising|| Haikyuu 402
||Or I guess I mean the ts in general|| ^
I still haven't read the latest OP chapter lol
scans
do you wait for official?
I wonder why Doen hmmmm
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
||I guess that's sorta fair. I guess if there is a precedent or expectation set by other sports manga then I can see why some were offput by the idea of a ts. But imo, I would find it very surprising if after reading what Furudate produced in the ts, that people would still dislike/criticize it. Your irl friend, I can totally understand.|| Haikyuu 402 mai
||but did you dislike the actual content of the ts Adam or just the idea that there was one rather than showing the remaining Karasuno years?|| haikyuu 402
||I disagree with that Adam, but I can see where you're coming from. I just think that in 5 years down the line, we got year 2 and it was similar content to year 1, people would complain that it was becoming repetitive and stagnant.|| Haikyuu 402
||I very much doubt people would end up liking/accepting new first year characters in replace of the third years. It happens way too often in fiction. People just don't like change from the norm especially when they expect a certain precedent. If new first years joined, I'm assuming Hinata/Kageyama/Tsukki would still be the main focus, and we'd end up just replacing already loved and established characters with newbies who people won't care about. And the volleyball content would be similar.|| Haikyuu 402
||I also don't think Haikyuu would suit being a 1000+ chapter series. Idk much about Ippo, but I hear a lot of people complain about it's "unnecessary length". I really wouldn't want the main Haikyuu story just copied and pasted two more times for the sake of seeing Hinata "grow". I just feel like Furudate made a very clever decision and for me at least, did not sacrifice any enjoyment. Most likely increased it ngl|| Haikyuu 402
Haikyuu 402, ||and we were told the outcome of the 2nd and 3rd years at nationals. It would be very similar stuff with Hinata and Kageyama getting better each year. I don't know what more developments on the volleyball side of things people were expecting. I'm very confident that a 2nd and 3rd year would just be very similar to year 1 whilst losing more and more of the main cast we spent 400 chapters loving.||
||The funny thing is, I wasn't at all surprised by the implementation of the ts. I wasn't for a second like "oh I was expecting this, lets see where this goes". I instantly believed that this was the right path Furudate could have taken. Just enjoyed this shit outa of it|| Haikyuu 402
yeh its a webtoon
my bad
||I just felt that first year alone was so thrilling a story that it works perfectly on its own. To me, that's the story of Haikyuu. I was left feeling like something was still missing. || Haikyuu 402
||I have to disagree Adam. The potential for more and more story telling is there in One Piece because the way Oda has structured it. One Piece could not end rn and feel like a complete story. There's still so much left missing. Whereas imo, the beginning of Haikyuu to the end of nationals felt like it's own, fully fleshed out story that could easily work on its own. And quite frankly did. The ts was just the cherry on top. I just didn't see the need for longevity in a series like Haikyuu where I feel like what story needed to be told, had already been told, and that fans just wanted more Haikyuu, without realizing that it would most likely just be more of the same.|| Haikyuu 402
||Red is Kenma confirmed|| Haikyuu 402
well I really enjoyed that discussion
<:PES_TuxedoToast:585724570082738178>
||when your argument isn't good enough to be featured in Adam's rebuttle||
<:CryBoy:585546888175157258>
jk
Mai just summed it up
||Obviously their growth as people isn't finished at the age of 16. They haven't discovered their purpose through a volleyball game. But the moments of development we saw from each character were relevant for the story of Haikyuu. It's a story about volleyball. It's also a story about character growth. How do you combine the two? Tanaka is a perfect example. He was right, he really was just an average, surface level guy, but he learned how that can still be useful and why it's not necessarily a bad thing through a game of volleyball, within the confines of the story. As Mai said, there's just no way Furudate could show us every single piece of development and lesson these characters learn whilst also showing them through meaningful moments such as Tsukki's block. For what we got, it's completely reasonable and realistic the way Furudate developed these characters.|| Haikyuu 402
||but they didn't fix or sort out their entire lives. Furudate gave us some key flaws with each character, and they eventually learned a lesson through volleyball. They didn't become enlightened or anything. It's just an interesting way to develop characters through a sport without it being super life changing or awakening.|| Haikyuu 402
||I don't really understand his argument tho. Is he saying it's impossible for people to find themselves in the context of a year of highschool? || Haikyuu 402
bday?
oh ok
fuck youuuuu
<:LUL:321931602655707136>

aight thanks
legit thought you linked me some furry fanfic Choc <:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
||I wouldn't really accuse him of being a copout. But I do think there isn't much of a substantial argument for a 2nd and 3rd year, and most fans probably just wanted more Haikyuu, whereas I thought the ending was perfect as it was|| Haikyuu 402
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
ok, Adam you gotta come back and say something
where'd you go?

<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
All day every day
Just assume I’m lying
Tends to be everyone else’s strategy
You want my opinion
One piece is by far more important than anything you have done, are doing, or will ever do. So with that being said. You should probably get some sleep
Same
I hate it
I HATE IT
Yeh but you’re probably in a competent country where Corona isn’t as bad
Whereas we’re in this cesspool
Yes! I always wanted to call you Shim but didn’t know if you’d like it
So now I can finally call you SHIM
Shortened names are always the way to go
Ewwww
Being such a bad student you completely forgot you had AP psych homework <:viviPanic:738523407808856145>
This was a couple of years ago, what’s done is done
<:MoriaFeels:544294371512811521>
Imagine even featuring on it
<:Uso:637751966184767546>
Youss knows the feeling
I remember when I first started I literally only used <#164971940648321024>
Now I avoid it as much as possible
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
Very true Shim
Also now that we’re so big, you just get a swarm of white names in there which isn’t a bad thing, but I can’t even get a word in
So
Yeh, you get this white name who asks a very lewd and uncomfortable question
Then I yeet

||you don't like Griffith? Like as a villain?|| Berserk 94+
I know how to make a lotta people on here mad, real quick
he opened them?????
gdi
you silly silly man
I'm good at not opening stuff
yeh Laww, definitely not to simp <:LuffyTruthful:671944878569160714>
Tendou is better than Kuroo imo
^
really?
I have 2
I said that to him recently as well lol
I understand Stranger as well now
||1. Tsukki 2. Oikawa 3. Atsumu 4. Kageyama 5. Bokuto 6. Hinata||
||0. Shimizu 😉  1. Tsukki 2. Oikawa 3. Atsumu 4. Kageyama 5. Bokuto 6. Hinata 7. Nishi 8. Kenma 9. Ushi 10. Ukai||
||Bokuto reminds me of Mirio from MHA|| Haikyuu and MHA
I'm like the only one with Kageyama in my top 5
they do, he's a mixture. ||Bokuto has can be darker and more intense, but they both have that seemingly never-ending enthusiasm that is almost contagious. But he's definitely a mix of other characters. But I get some Mirio vibes from him|| Haikyuu 402 mai
oh sorry Cho
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
notice me
notice me!!!!!!!!!!!!
is he not?
I thought i had him on there
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
<:LuffyTruthful:671944878569160714>
nahhhh
haikyuu manga  ||1. Inarizaki 2. Shiratorizawa 3. Final Game 4. Nekoma 5. Aobajohsai 2||
it will
trust
||its the best game|| haikyuu manga
I love ringo
Haikyuu manga||I still felt tense as fuck reading that game even tho I was like 95% certain they'd win||
best girl Toko
Haikyuu manga ||maybe my predictions were just too good, coz I had guessed they'd beat Inarizaki and Nekoma, but I knew they would lose against Kamomedai||
I tend to looks at Mai's anilist anyway when I want recs
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
I love Toko's VA
forgot they used Dogstorm and Catviper <:Crydo:586275183032270849>
can't be Bean
stop lying
||the only reason the results mattered were so we could get more matches Mai <:LULW:607641487429206106> || Haikyuu manga
the power of the Rayleigh flashback is strong today
why is it only Luffy and Zoro mid episode things
Mai, Haikyuu manga,|| did you prefer Hinata and Kageyama's block against Inarizaki, or Hinata's spike vs Shiratorizawa?||
true
me too
I love Tendou v
very cool
thanks Jeff
Much love
<:BokutoPeace:711792459226808508>
Fine, I'll use my true favorite character as a pfp
that's not why
I made mine coz bubs changed hers to Tendou
so I wanted to one up her
I'm still cringe don't you worr
can someone give me back my spade pirates role
I hate this color
and the civilians role
I know but it still says I have it, but because Moe manually changed it, it doesn't show up
what about now
THERE WE GO
nvm
idk
oh god
don't snitch
<:LuffyTruthful:671944878569160714>
Mai didn't you say ur changing soon?
not cultured, just horny
lol
"spreading the word"
is it free?
Mai is a waifu tbf
because it's him irl
Idk what pfp to use
I'm just gonna go back to a default discord pfp
make people not know who I am
tag what series that's from
please
I'm kinda bored of my normal pfp
yeh maybe I'll just use a Berserk pfp
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
join the marines
<:CobySalute:638916402467569675>

Sidra is ur pfp Momo?
I guess not
lol
she's from MHA
<@!510934064610541580> can you put the series ur talkin about before the tag please, I'm not caught up with AoT <:LuffyWave:356709589670035456>
oh no problem
speaking of the giants, I once met Tim Lincecum
for like 2 seconds lol
sucks to be a giants fan atm
dem racoons be arsonist
1???
1 is number 1
isn't that just a mashup of all the other openings?
Mai is back to Mai
I'm not anime only, but I'm not up to date and to be honest, I've completely forgotten what happens
lol
yeh I think I remember that Shim
but that's about it
he thinks he's watching me
when actually
I'm the one watching him
https://youtu.be/E6T8SksLtXg?t=191 this is my favorite OST from AoT
at the timestamp
<a:aPES_TripleEyes:688793967751725135>
those were the Tim Lincegoat days
what's the score btw
> You were considered youss <@!380840459641159683> WAS I???????
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
jk
people think DFs spawn to the nearest fruit coz of the smiley incident
but that's never been confirmed
LMAO fleeb
what kinda question is that?
If I were in one piece I'd be yonko coz I clearly have that kinda power and influence in the real world
<:CrocoKidEvenMoreDistorted:586469633419378704>
I don't what ur talking about
you wanna know the character I could theoretically be right now?
the fucking marine who Akainu murders for fleeing
that would be me
anyone else would be pulling stuff outta my ass
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
4 HOURS STRAIGHT WTF
> Don't worry Evan, just face it. Between you and me, we all know I fit the bill better for the user on the sidelines grabbing popcorn 🍿 <@!165877926498140161> LMAO
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
If the mods ever make a meme and need regulars, I'd be the fodder character that gets killed to the side of the panel
nah, coz even that dude got lines
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
I'd be some lineless fodder who is only halfway in the panel
um, 110 I think
I really need to pick up the pace
do you think there's even a chance of Luffy's mom never being revealed?
I think so too
good joke
who, Dragon?
oh
for a second Choc, I thought you had a stroke, but then realized you were saying Don Quixote Homing
nah
show me
I want to see <:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>

Idk, I don't see it happening, I don't see how it would work
my dad watches ice road truckers and moonshiners
hasn't quite made it to anime yet
I think so too
The not eating I think is probably from photosynthesis due to his fruit
TECHNICALLY. There is an argument for it being any of the 3 which is really cool
but yeh I think paramecia is the most likely
I wish I had your dads
My mom makes fun of me for "looking like one of those anime characters"
> JSG=Just Super Great <@!216582410756685824> <:BepoBlush:544527768583667747> ur making me blush
you just quoted urself <:LULW:607641487429206106>

<:LULW:607641487429206106>
!rank
really? I respect guys with long hair
mine isn't long at the back tho, just looks like a mess
it's said that wood from the treasure tree adam is the most durable wood in the world. I think franky told a story about how there were constant wars on this one island but the adam trees were never destroyed

<:LULW:607641487429206106>
but that blue is a nice color
yeh, I'd only be this orange or that blue

so, you'd be seeing me from like 4 years ago
wait so ur picture will be from 3 years ago as well?
I'm big chad <:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
yeh true
i don't really mind
let's do it
k lemme find a decent picture first <:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
OH GOD HAHAHAHAHA
I have so many cringey shirtless pictures during my teen "gym" phase where I worked out like crazy
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
God I was cringe
not anymore
sadly
I'm still looking for one that isn't super cringey
gimme a sec
nah I look like a mess rn
NO
I am not
OMG I can't find a non-cringey one but I guess this will have to do
k Viri, I'm ready if you are
v cute
for sure
yeh it can't be
ooooooh
I'm bored
I wanna play something
I'm waiting for ur's I'm ready
Ok but keep in mind this is from 2016
Orange
Ok
Black <:Emoji:612670056161214508>
Full emo
That’s the best option
Very much so
Pasta irl

that's probably the only way to become actually fluent
gotta speak with native speakers
or people who are already fluent
in normal conversations
ok, I'll get mine ready
yeh mine's from 2016
ok, context first. My friend wanted to do some weird filter thing with people's faces, so I just sent him a very bland photo
WE'RE FRATERNAL
ok 2016, very bland me coming up

fuck it
that's me four years ago
<:BrookShrug:680559335058702376>
yep, I have a baby face
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
that's coz I am younger than you lmao
K VIRI NOW UR TURN <:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
I am part spanish technically
nawwwww
k I hardly take selfies, and the very few I have of current me, I look homesless
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
coz my friend asked for a very still picture
he wanted to do these weird edit filter things
never Moe
I already know what Pasta looks like
<:MoriaFeels:544294371512811521>
and Doom
no way you've seen Doom
of current us?
oh man, gotta take a decent picture first <:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
out of the mods ... lets see
I've seen Moe, Bean, Jeff, and I think that's it
lurkers <a:aPES_Spit:688793967747530842>
😷
big sad
just study the book of the One Piece
yeh no wonder power scalers are so stupid Pasta
they took ur class
I moved straight onto advanced powerscaling
only for the elite
I taught Pasta everything he knows
none of you would pass my class
it takes a very high capacity for learning to pass
don't need to know how to read, if you are the book itself
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
imagine a class called "evan won't be a mod 101" <:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
I am Doom's apprentice
I already am
yes, I'm his padawan
I'm useless with technology as well Sab
<a:aPES_CryDrown:644479445637529620>
do it
yes and I'm yours

I've grown I promise!!!!
what the hell

it's funny, my mom said the same thing the other day
<:PES_CryTeddy:643089269614968851>
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
i would ping all the mods asking if I could be their apprentice, but they'd just get mad lmao
Red is the LAST person who'd take me on as apprentice
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
hell nah, I'm not that brave
the funny thing is
me and Archer agree on almost everything
it's weird
I think he's copying me
ur cringe
I have my application ready

I think the answer really inhabited my ambition and talents
ofc lmao
at least I hope it is
NO BUBS
get it away
<a:runningemote:735442727239417917>
btw guys. I didn't get to 10 hours last night
of listening to the Guts theme
I want an example of a good regular
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
Youss
I tell people where to get a role, or to spoiler tag their stuff. Or to stop being annoying if they're spamming. But that's only because I'm genuinely annoyed and want them to stop
kinda
that's coz I took like a 5 month break lol
yeppers
oh come on
I joined December last year
but didn't speak for like 5 months, because I didn't know how to post images
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
idk
I remember the first person I talked to was YC
who is?
BUBS????!!!
very clearly
yeh I didn't start talking til this year
that's coz Apoo is the worst character in the series
so I am the worst member of the server <:Crydo:586275183032270849>
ugggggh I'm bored as hell

<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
one day maybe
I don't upload anything lol
that would probably be my name lol
I can play a few instruments
none to a high level tho
maybe except piano, but that's not even that high level
I have played piano, guitar, violin, and french horn
kinda a wide range lmao
I can only play piano, and a little bit of guitar still
I had to quit french horn
hurt my mouth <:LULW:607641487429206106>
yep Sab
I also have asthmas
so not a good idea for me
I also hate the taste of metal
when I first started learning
I had to share a mouthpiece with 3 other dudes
that was nasty
<a:GutsMegaCry:721314623495733288>
welcome back
DAMMIT ZYPH
yeh Sab, I just said screw it, and went back to piano and guitar
wait what did you win Viri?
I wanna read/see all the art stuff

me and my twin always say the same thing at the same time
it's not fair
I thought I told you this before no?
humans are disgusting creatures
I want lasers
mine was a cougar
this is gonna sound like a dumb question
but how did people brush their teeth back then?
or clean them
really?
interesting
<:WapolTriggered:587621943725916180>
really?
wapol
I don’t think it’s a lie
I think it’s genuinely a big battleship
Uranus idk
Could be anything
That’s actually interesting
Coz when you think about it
It’s taken them centuries to build a bridge that isn’t even finished
So how did the red line get made so quickly?
Interesting
It is
I dunno about the red line, but I think Continent pullers pulled many islands together to form Wano. Hence all the different climates
dude, the lord of the coast is much smaller than the ones we saw at FMI
lmao
<:Uso:637751966184767546>
> a classic <@!186562609254891520>  did you like the meme fats? <a:aPES_Laugh:664885767574781964>
I would never actually tell you stfu
I wouldn’t say that to anyone
I’d hit you with the “no u” fats
Can’t come back from that
It’s true
Me and fats are alts
But you said it
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
I’m just some guy
<:AkainuSweat:586408945137090571>
Are you still on holiday?
I’m meant to be in Hawaii rn
<:Crydo:586275183032270849>
Actually next week I’m going on vacation
I’m going to a ranch in Tennessee, gonna be a cowboy for a week
<a:aPES_Laugh:664885767574781964>
Sounds nice
I’m gonna be riding horses everyday for a week. I’m kinda nervous
Did you see Pasta’s meme then?
I’ve never ridden a horse
Oh nice
I live in NC so it’s like a 2 hour drive
How was it?
I just gotta remember to never stand behind one
Coz they kick
Sometimes
It’s soooo cheap
Yeh Viri <:PES_ReeCowboy:585724569617170432>
There’s no WiFi and barely any signal
So ur gonna be without me for a week
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
That’s the dream
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
You’d miss me the second I leave
<:Uso:637751966184767546>

I have never played animal crossing
<a:7860_bob_danceing:738791613446488078>
Someone told me the game is about collecting taxes from villagers, is that true?
I’m telling you guys
I’m gonna make a WoW guild for the server, and ur all gonna like it
<:Uso:637751966184767546>
Games in general are too expensive nowadays
We haven’t played MK in a while moe
And Viri
Yes we do
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
I will have my revenge
You can call me whatever I don’t mind
<:LUL:321931602655707136>

<:FujiWoke:638345772953370624>
How many chapters are there in conviction?
As in Berserk chapters
Yes
Flabbergast
Shouldn’t be a word
I hate the word, precipitation. Makes me cringe for some reason
Ah Viri, life wouldn’t be the same without your hilarious typos
<:pepelaugh:601460290457960500>
Oh nice
||I thought Rosine was actually a really nice villain. The apostles I’ve seen to this point, mainly sacrificed for more power or in Wyalds case, sex lol. But I actually felt sympathy for Rosine. Miura did a nice job with the whole innocent child in a fairy tale trope, for instance with the legend of Peekaf. This chapter just had a really nice fantasy vibe to it, with obviously a lot of Guts ripping people in half lol|| Berserk 117
Huh
Coz they’re white names
Kill it!!!
Murder it
Butcher it
SEND IT TO HELL
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
Eat it then
Kill
Kill
Kill
And his hat is stupid
Bring back the old one
<:Uso:637751966184767546>
Yoooo I just thought of the best comparison to me for this server
I’m like Dwight from the office
my jokes are very original
I'm a very funny person
very funny
will do
I'm really tired so I might go back to sleep
Favorite character
||I’ve been thinking for a bit, but yeh, I think I prefer him to Guts. But not by much|| Berserk
Jinbe’s vagabond drill was fucking fire so let’s count him <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Where did he show it?
Why tf would he. So stupid to think he had it before Mihawks training
Ryuo is just Wanos term for armament haki
No he wasn’t
> "six king pistol" for the six clans of wano @aleksandr.hashimikov#7872  <:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
Nerd
They’re martial arts techniques specifically designed for assassination like tasks. Nothing to do with will as Pasta said
Most likely, the master swordsmen use it on their swords
Actually ... most definitely
I don’t understand your logic
Stop making connections that just aren’t there to fit your headcanon
No they don’t
I thought it just said Lucci
Pre ts
WHAT????
> imo cp9 might have been trained in wano @aleksandr.hashimikov#7872  this is easily debunkable
Cp9 are government trained assassins. Wano is independent of the WG’s domain. Why tf would they be trained on Wano, we already where they were trained
<:LUL:321931602655707136> <:LUL:321931602655707136> <:LUL:321931602655707136>
<:SengokuPalm:701663557338529802>
Luffy is from Wano coz he did the pose in bound man
<:CrocoDurr:663850964763279381>
People. Just assume, the nothing we saw during Enies Lobby, was haki
When did it come out?
Zyph do u have a switch ?
Do u have MK?
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
Tonight ?
I’m. Free
Yeh some douchebag manga reader would just go into anime theories and say manga stuff as if he doesn’t know
For chad points
The admin
You guy you pinged is Red
What does that mean
<@380840459641159683> good ol Rigatoni
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
What kinda food?
One of my favorites
But this lack of service should not be tolerated
I might have to intervene
is it kbbq?
you should tell them you're a member of the r/onepiece discord server
they'd obey your every whim
idk about other states. But literally no restaurants have opened back up in my area
so it's been home food or chick fila mostly lol
15 lbs?
my pleasure
Strong, start running
but then like
don't stop running
send pics if you can
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
but that will bring you to 600 lbs
isn't that a bit much?
👀
oh so you'll be a THICC boi
I see
1200, is honestly the max I can see it
I don't even think over 1200
I think Oda is genuine about the 5 years thing
we get 38 chapters on average, this year even less by the looks of it
so no
I don't think we're reaching over 1200
certainly not 1300
doubt it
you can
thriller bark was 48 chapters
amazon lily was like 11
sabaody was about 24 iirc
impel down was 25
mf 30
I have too much free time
realistically. we're at the 78 chapter mark of wano. I honestly think we only have maybe 40 chapters left (at most). I think the final saga can easily be finished within the 1020-1200 range
180 chapters for a saga is reasonable
we only don't know the location of the 4th
uh oh
I mean ... it was never said that they didn't do that during the fb so....
But I think it makes more sense if it was WB or Shanks
but it's still possible Archer
WB is the sage guess
Why would Roger take the poneglyph tho if he was gonna go straight to Laugh Tale
kinda seems like a nuisance
telling WB about it seems like a safe bet
elbaf <:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
gotta believe
that would be a good idea actually
coz it's such an irrelevant island
who tf would want to go there
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
Elbaf is the safe bet
orrrrr
Loadstar??
maybe
idk
have we always had this?
yeh its really cool
i like it a lot
how old is Kuro?
get gud at one piece Shimon
people's varying sizes in one piece is such an Oda thing to do and I love it
like it's just normal to be 9 feet tall
makes character designs way more interesting
by the looks of it, you seemed to know what you're doing pretty well <:LULW:607641487429206106>
its really good
hello
can I get a "nice" from everyone please
has your food arrived yet fats?
I'm 5'7 but I tell people I'm 6 feet
Archer big chungus
no you need a faction my guy
well if you told people you were 6 feet archer, there wouldn't be any ladies for the rest of us. So I thank you for your sacrifice
I wonder how tall I am?
I'm the BIGGEST boi
pfffffft fleeb
don't even compare
Archer has SPPS
Doom thinks I'm a manlet
screw finding the one piece, I need to find out the mystery of the "girl"
have I been summoned?
why
oh
I am indeed the pinnacle of modern masculinity \
Marc is close
no one is ever "attacked" here, as long as they don't say stupid things
woah, a wild cuck as arrived
oh dw Youss
I'm a big cuck
I don't attack
I protect
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
aren't you two actually considering becoming roomies or was that mainly a meme?
should I read or watch Chihaya
?
no I meant Bean and Sab
but I'm sure you're excellent roommate material
and you like one piece
my criteria is met
👉 👈
basically, I only wanna watch stuff if the adaptation is unanimously better than the manga
so if they're practically even, I'll just read it
I'm sorry ..
8 baskets ..
of marble?
why?
marbles
really?
I thought you both told me to read after s3
I could be wrong
I don't remember
did he now
😡
fuccck I almost clicked that
close call
ngl, this is gonna sound cringe
but I kinda liked having red and mai etc... for my readthrough of Haikyuu. Nice to have people who are already passionate about a series spur you on like that
<:BepoBlush:544527768583667747>
I promise you I'm not gay
not ur dick
I don't care who's dick it is
ok now that just sounds gay
gdi
<a:runningemote:735442727239417917>
<:BepoSad:626931310241251360>
wait who's cringe>
me or youss?
ok good
k gonna go walk the doggos
brb
I'm back
who missed me
they're good. My pug almost had a heart attack coz he's so unfit. lmao
he's ok tho
who gave you that nickname? <:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
it fits
I remember these fucking things
oh god
<:NamiFlush:625741106193367054>
the mods are just using Youss's name to have an argument
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
<a:REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEGIF:393866924192432158>
my name gets changed a lot and I haven't even lost a bet
not as much as youss tbf
gdi
some are funny tbf
and everyone knows who he is
so its not like it confuses people
yeh
I'm bout to share your fate tho
wait what
yeh people change their actual discord names instead of their server nicknames
<:CrocoKidEvenMoreDistorted:586469633419378704>
||eat it||
that's gotta suck
did you forget you even made it?
incomes another one
yeh, I was convinced he was dead as well
Mine is on orochi being dead
and I'm 90% he is still alive
so I'm fucked
hmmm ... maybe I should use it as a pfp?
<:LuffyThink:701983952482599032>
my bet is with smelly
about whether Orochi actually died
I said yes
but now I don't think it's true
yes
with smelly it's infinite
coz I was so sure
of myself
lemme see if I can find it
k I can't find the actual bet itself, but here's proof it exists. I'm completely fucked
I actually like Yamaguchi
<:Uso:637751966184767546>
is my name actually changed
yep
fuck
not that bad
||Ushijima was a good server, but it wasn't his specialty || Haikyuu manga
I keep thinking it's Archer typing lol
yes
I agree
cucky niichan
wtf
I nEvEr KnEw HiS nAmE wAs YoUsS
<:rebki:374759708223078400>
you can call me Evan
I don't mind
you can call me perry the fucking platypus I don't really care
