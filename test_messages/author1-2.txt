That's the other thing, sea kings could just chew through its leg
Her trunk can't reach underwater like that
The legs probably wouldn't be able to do much, they're munching on it lol
It couldn't, it reaches into the sky
Jack was one thing, he was on the surface
Sea kings attacked its *feet*?
I doubt Zunesha can reach that far
It ducks down, and its truck still can't reach well
This is bottom of the ocean potentially
And even getting in, there's no swing zunesha could do to fight them off
It'd be in water lol
Unless it can use the trunk to crush them or something, it's still useless
Because of Hancock's snakes, yeh
They're afraid of the venom
It does not, lol
So you take encephalograms?
Well, Calm Belt sea kings are the average
The ones like the Lord of the Coast are outliers
But, they are intelligent yeh
Ahh
Another banger theory <:CrocoKid:487633532907159552>
You could be right tho, what if one of the last Poseidons was a Kozuki?
It doesn't have to be, we just know it from the series
the Calm Belt sea kings are *the* creatures, they're not the unique ones
I believe so yeh
Just certain mermaids
It's their nesting grounds because of the weather, dax
No choppy waters
There's no weather at all
A sea king tsunami is probably how they end up wrecking an island <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Just full on sink it
No killua, not unless they're moving in groups constantly
I said that earlier, lol
Uranus may be something for creation instead
Killua, there's a difference between a *current* and a *wake*
They create a wake
They won't make a current unless they're all going together
That does happen, killua
Sea kings just don't surface unless someone is sailing above, so you don't see it

Chap 525 btw
The damn readonepiece site cuts the page
So I had to google for it lmao

Only bad thing about the site I swear
they just can't do a spread right
I mean...don't knock it till you've tried it
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
Kade?
LOL I'll try to get it back up at some point
COVID unfortunately made me pause it
BEAN'S BEANS
I should've used that lmfao
Lmfao a coffee stache
I think that may come across wrong for some folks <:LUL:321931602655707136>
LOL
brb throwing it on my bags
He can understand what they're saying yeh
Oh, I misread that, I thought you were saying he couldn't understand the sea kings and such
yeh poneglyphs have powerful auras
The same "voice" you hear with observation haki
That also wouldn't make sense in the context of his character, he rose to being an Emperor because he's such an unstoppable monster
Even considering his losses, he's only lost 7 times in his whole life, that's pretty impressive
why does Sanji need something unique to him?
Sanji's got one of the most unique fighting styles in the crew
Nami's invisibility is canon
Zeo?
Oh, FMI dude
He's probably dead now
lol
Yeh, it's a mirage technique
She can turn invisible and make clones
But Sanji's still unique about it
He, nami, Shiliew and Zero all have entirely different ways of doing it, which is cool
She was invis and made clones I believe
Juba you're probably right about that
^
It seems like you get to the same point eventually no matter what
Just you might lean one way harder than the other, like the emotion bit
>Artur
<:LUL:321931602655707136><:LUL:321931602655707136><:LUL:321931602655707136>
<@!415999229564157955> No, it's because of speedreading
but it doesn't help for sure
^
I like how ubiquitous it is, there's at least one person in every arc besides the strawhats who can use fire I'm pretty sure
And of the strawhats, almost everyone can use fire attacks lmao
Sanji, Zoro, Luffy, Nami, Franky, Usopp
Can all use fire
And I'll add Kinemon as honorable mention
Y'know what I'll take nami out, 'cause she just makes heat but not full on fire

Yeh, she also turns invisible lol
I think not defending is more important than being drunk
He was also drunk fighting Luffy and didn't get a scratch
Like, the whole raid?
We've had almost 4 different arcs
Dedicated to reaching the point of this one attack
I don't think anyone underplays it tbh
Yeah, bad headcanon will get in the way of appreciating the story
but that's a them problem, not a story problem lol
And the 20 years it took to get there
Nah, that was entirely the fact that the scabbards came out of nowhere when they were supposed to be dead
Didn't know*
It's not like Orochi hasn't been raving about it for 20 years <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Pfft, Lucci was hardly in better shape than Luffy
Yeh, unlike Luffy, Lucci actually had to take his hits lol
No, he was just exhausted and barely conscious
Mostly from his gears, from what Lucci seemed to imply
Dried empty...of blood?
Katakuri wasn't leagues ahead
And he himself points out how close Luffy is to him
Don't let your headcanon ruin the fight
Katakuri's armament wasn't stronger when Luffy was using Gear 4th, and Luffy was steadily closing in on his future sight
Katakuri also couldn't use it consistently towards the end of the fight
And his fruit wasn't the upgraded version of Luffy's, he could just pull similar gimmicks lol
He also didn't just choose to lose or fall down instead of fighting
Katakuri was giving it his all, he passed out because he couldn't fight anymore
Yes, Luffy can't sustain it, and Katakuri let him keep fighting
That's the only thing that happened in Luffy's favor, Katakuri wanted the fight to finish
Ugh I can't wait for that to die
Mihawk had to teach Zoro haki
So it wasn't that back then
If it was, absolutely wasn't the second form of it lol
It does, mip
Ryuo is just haki
The levels are the lengths of projection
Yeah, and it does have levels lol
What are you saying exactly?
Yeh it wasn't ryuo lmao
It's not, otherwise Hyogoro wouldn't have been able to oversee his training
tanu
Hyogoro taught Luffy
with his bare hands
What is this speedreading rn lmao
Rofl yeh, it's more a translation than the actual card
Stop
No spoilers at all here, pls
You can talk about the current episode freely, nothing past
And nothing that may be spoiled in the opening
The anime is at 936
So you can talk about 934 just fine
Sure üëçüèæ As long as it's not spoiling future episodes or events
No that's fine, if it's been animated it's free game
I'm caught up, we stream the episodes a little after they drop here every Saturday
Yeh costa, that's what he says pretty much
Armament, at the least
They don't seem to have a word for conqueror's yet
And they may not have a concept of observation either tbh
Well, the thing is costa, he's referring to it in reference to Luffy using armament
Tanu, we've seen exactly one person from Wano confirmed using it lmao
Everyone else has just used general armament haki
<@!337779264130646021> That's also the other thing, we've seen more samurai use general basic armament than anything
^ Evidently using the technique that can actually harm him, too
That's in a lot of headcanon, tanu
They've never actually talked about haki before
Before Hyogoro decided to teach Luffy
We know he means armament haki specifically and not all kinds tho
Because he specifies it's the power that can flow into your sword from around your body
<@!690158729685106749> Yeah, they didn't do that because that's objectively incorrect lol
Why should everyone agree to it for only that? That's like saying we can only use mantra for basic observation, but not the extended version
<@!704073918759043093> Doesn't seem to be, off the top of my head
Mostly because he used to push his aggressively shallow headcanon
Now it's just a meme <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Well, he did it a bit more shady than that. It wasn't like he just made bad theories, he'd do translations and "facts" but pepper in his own opinion to decide an issue instead of just an unbiased translation
Arturpiece was just overly wanked'
But beyond that, I don't t hink anyone really dislikes him, lol
Since it was my hit, tell him to shoot me a FR and I'll let him know
I don't want him back yeh
He was out because of a lot of degenerate derailing and weird ass creep comments, ugh
<@!564773067969265674> It'd be like he'd translate a vivre card and insert something that was just clear not on the card at all
He did it in multiple channels too, I wouldn't have even cared if he stuck to at least one place to be lolrandom
<@!145193576165408769> I just realized I wasn't in koya's server, my b
Have you talked to him more? 'Cause I can shoot him a DM if not
That'd be really interesting
It didn't seem like their clash took long enough for that tho
^
I feel like Roger told him, and instead of getting it
He knew Fishman Island would be in danger if it was kept there
So he moved it
fr fats
The slightest thing out of place and it all breaks, ugh
I like your dedication
pls keep going rofl
Make one of Kaido turning into a dragon tho pls
fats real talk
when this quarantine is done and gone
we're having a BBQ
night frost
Either my amazing new pad in Oregon, or your amazing new pad that you'll probably have by then too
No but really, I'd be down to host a gathering
When I'm fully moved in and settled
Aaay
Sab and I are already planning to hang when I get up there
I'll be so close I'll probably end up seeing him a lot
Just move in at some point, why not lmao
Blackbeard's already offered to let him live by joining the crew
He doesn't care about the strength
>The Worst Generation
Not really, more just people conveniently liking him enough to help
But, Luffy also went out of his way to challenge the government
Evidently, most other pirates don't do that
Nepotism when?
Kuma only ever saved the strawhats once, and that wasn't a deus ex machina, it just hasn't been explained yet
But was part of a larger scheme
People usually want to kill Luffy because of his father and grandfather
And being related to them has caused him endless trouble lol
Being trained by Rayleigh wasn't nepotism
And like...all of them were already laid out beforehand
The only thing out of nowhere is Bege's help with any of it
It's not a deus ex machina if the series has spent time meticulously building up these elements coming together
That's not even a deus ex machina, that's just a poor red herring
But, that was pretty convenient for it to be like...literally just handwaved lol
Nami having more of the card makes sense to me, she's a planner
He absolutely realizes it
I'm pretty sure he's already acknowledged it, even
Maybe a couple of times
Well yeh, he's true to himself. Luffy has astounding strength of character, that's always been a thing
That's not something he'll ever stop
The entire point of the series is that the greatest pirates are free to do those things if they want
As far as that is concerned, that is
Given that he only told Luffy he may encounter people who do have it, I doubt it
I dunno, Zoro ripping out a weapon from his shoulder with his mouth and using it to finish off another powerful person felt a little more epic for me
Even tho Hyogoro's had a deeper meaning
He didn't seem to be someone who could use it, judging by how he told Luffy about it
^
That's why I'm okay with him getting these things so fast tbh
'Cause he did spend two years training for it and had the concepts in mind already, but just couldn't use them
This is just him getting to sit and do it finally
And actually have an environment that sucks enough for him to get good with it, lol
Hyogoro may have been a little more iconic, but devastation always deserves more spectacle
Hyogoro was more wholesome
It's sooo behind
I can't wait for them to get to Big Mom chasing the Sunny tho
Jinbe ugh
But it was tho
Whitebeard tried and had a heart attack
I'm curious what you were gonna say tho
'cause I don't think Sengoku's conqueror's would've done much at all
Those instructions were the actual key to all of their victory, though
The entire reason they managed to pull a win was Sengoku's leadership lol
Yeah, they were all on the spot decisions
He just had an arsenal to choose from for his decisions
But he's the one who directed the movement of the entire navy, he's the one who decided when to use the walls, to have Sakazuki deceive Squard
No, it was Sengoku's plan naism
It takes a LOT to knock people out with conqueror's
The gap is so large that the person being knocked out isn't even worth fighting the user
The gap is so huge that Whitebeard's nameless people were able to stand against Shanks's
Hell, most of Big Mom's guests stood against hers
As soon as it happens, yeh
Which means Sengoku's the reason Whitebeard goes into the war even weaker than they could've hoped
Because that stab didn't stop him, but it was still a massive sword going through his chest and potentially spine
Luffy barely knocked anyone out, but yeah, I'm completely sure Sengoku would've failed to knock out almost everyone on the crew
If Shanks could only knock out less than half, I'm entirely sure Sengoku's missing the mark there
Yes, will of the target too
These were an Emperor's crewmates
He'd have knocked out a few I'm sure, since even Luffy does if I'm not mistaken, but it's not making a big dent
I'm pretty sure Luffy knocks out pirates too, but I don't remember tbh
No, but we've actually seen them take an Emperor's haki already
This isn't like a hypothesis, it's already happened lol
Most of Whitebeard's crew stood just fine against Shanks's, and according to Whitebeard that one was on full blast
So, we saw Whitebeard's crew take a full blast of Shanks's haki, and it knocked out maybe half at best
And only the rookies, at that
Why would Sengoku do even as good as that, let alone enough to make a difference in the war?
Kizaru was causing mass destruction in the war
People tend to forget we get plenty of collages of everyone getting down
Kizaru was actually flying around blowing everything up whenever he could
What else was he going to do in a war? rfl
Knocking out 50 people out of potentially 40,000 doesn't help very much lol
But, Luffy and Katakuri were just exhausted, Whitebeard's body was failing
Two very different scenarios occurred there
Tomorrow
Should be about 12pm EST, I think
That's a better way of saying it, it's still tomorrow for me lol
As for Kizaru, I believe we do see him taking on commanders
Oh yeh, actually, they can't hurt him come to think of it
He stopped Kizaru from blinking away when he did it, so he actually hits him
Kuzan opens a hole and lets the bisento just pass, it doesn't touch him
Srsly, more logias without future sight have done it with
In fact, no logias have done it with
Special paramecia fucking...
A heart attack was extremely debilitating and happened *as* Whitebeard was trying to do it. It physically stopped him. Luffy abd Katakuri were just exhausted and hurt, but still had hours and hours left of fight in them.  Whitebeard, in his last his last big fight, lasted maybe an hour or two. All of Marineford only took about 3. There really is no comparison here, Katakuri and Luffy had a lot more going for them on top of being able to stand and perform it without interruption. Now, if Luffy were able to do it as Katakuri skewered him, you'd have more of a point there.
The Ivankov thing was the years removal. What Luffy went through was the same thing Law did
Also, 50 people not worth fighting anyway getting knocked out in a war of over 100,000 is most definitely irrelevant.
That's the point of conqueror's, you're knocking out the people who didn't matter to the fight in the first place. If you can be downed by it, your numbers are as  irrelevant as you were to the person using it.
The worst effects were actually commented on when Luffy uses both gears at once
Not much for just gear 2nd. But the only other time in general it's ever mentioned is in Thriller Bark, right after Oars goes down and Chopper worries
A youtuber being wrong doesn't credit the argument tho
Anyone with a bounty of over 100 mil is admiral material
7-10?
^
But besides that, 100 mil was the official limit for when you're eligible for an admiral to be sent after you
If she's not a warlord anymore, unless they're all busy, she does deserve one
She's actually probably the least vulnerable warlord currently active
She had an entire island and army backing her up
On top of the Calm belt itself protecting her area
I thought 7-10 was a bit much, lol
I guess Blackbeard maybe?
So potentially 8
7 if not Blackbeard
Maybe 9 if Beckman can do it?
Probably not Garp tbh
Or the admirals
There are two Emperors who just declared they're going to go for the ancient weapons and open war on the world with them, and get to Laugh Tale either soon after or right before
This is the literal worst case scenario for the government rn
The marines almost have no choice but to intervene
They can't just up and find the weapons before Big Mom and Kaido
They don't have the information for it
And Kaido potentially knows exactly where one weapon is already
Well, I only mention it because we learned Sengoku does already, and I just figured if any other marines did we'd have learned about it by now too
They may reveal it later, who knows
whoa
Did someone just say the only strong sweet commander is Katakuri?
wtf
Cracker can make an infinite army of things you need to be as strong as Gear 4th to beat
Where would they get information? Kaido and Big Mom don't seem to know any either
Two Emperors declaring war on the world is a direct threat to the celestial dragons
^ There is no one safe from this
They are trying to wage war on the entire world
It's not even like they're just stockpiling to rule, they *want* conflict
This is an assault, people will get involved if it doesn't end with the raid
They were in Wano weeks ago
We don't know if they still are or not
> You brought it here and you're saying off topic? Seriously <@!198930928083402753> <@!736943713439449099> He was calling himself out for mentioning something off topic during a conversation
Chill
Because they had a deal in place already, they didn't need a spy
And no spy would help that, Orochi's demands were more than they could take
Likewise, they wouldn't want there being any hint at all of a spy in general
Just like they won't just use Drake to attack Kaido instead of sending other marines in
If Kaido went by himself to Marineford he would have absolutely been slaughtered
Like, without question and probably without more than just a lot of collateral damage
The man would have no chance storming the place and living
He very well might have, we've never seen him travel with a crew
No, he was intercepted, we don't know if he had a ship
^ You guys should know that just because you're choosing to be under someone doesn't mean you're a yes man
Sengoku absolutely was not
Not at all lol
If he doesn't land, he wouldn't actually be able to do anything
His boro breath is strong, sure
But between Whitebeard, the commanders, the admirals, the Fleet Admiral, and Garp?
Kaido's not touching anyone lol
Garp couldn't even handle Whitebeard
No one is handling Whitebeard *and* Kaido
If they're not expecting him, they'd still be seeing a massive fireball falling out of the sky and need to either defend or get out of the way
Yeh, and unless Kaido brings his crew with him, he'd just be another corpse
They'd just go after him instead of chasing down the surviving Whitebeard pirates
Since he's a much bigger issue
And if he were anywhere near powerful enough to actually take the marines on alone, there would be no balance in the world
He'd be the undisputed king lol
It's been shown multiple times
Just only once as a defense
It is yes
No, it is the advanced kind
It's the kind Hyogoro can use
Ryuo is just armament haki, but yes, it is the kind that Hyogoro knows
The projection ability
Yeh, including Kid, there's 8
Not including blackbeard
Zeph said in or around, and all the Supernovas were there
Several people have used it yeh
More non-admirals have in fact
He does not
He has a specific technique is all
His Ashigara Dokkoi is how he attacks with the armament, it's not a different term or anything
^
Just with a lot less range it seems, but yeh, it's a projection
And it's what the admirals, Sentoumaru, the Boa sisters, Rayleigh, Hyogoro, Whitebeard and Roger have all used
Potentially the scabbards just did as well
And it seemed that Whitebeard and Roger using it was so particularly powerful their swords didn't even touch
Sengoku was never really told to do anything, he just followed the law and organized things as best he could
The only time he's been really stepped over was at Marineford when the Gorosei wanted to cover up the breakout at Impel Down
Wasn't the first?
What orders were Sengoku ever given?
What about Ohara?
Of course he did
He's the one who organized the Buster call for it
and told Saul to shut up about questioning it
lol
Oh yeh, of course. Whitebeard and Roger fought a lot
So much their crews became friends even though they're enemies
Yeh, Oden was the one who'd never seen that before
So I imagine that means that the technique is both advanced enough that not many people on Wano know it, especially if Hyogoro was famous for it in particular, and its strength is generally a lot less than what they showed
Yeh
Katakuri wouldn't betray Big Mom
lol
Sengoku is the kind of guy who thinks dealing with criminals is right
He's not some saint, he was the head of the marines
Everything people think was bad at Marineford, for example, was entirely on Sengoku
The Buster Call was just fine, otherwise he'd have dismantled it when he was promoted
Yep, we can see that from when Shanks and Whitebeard meet
no
Yeh, that seems to be the idea
Blow him up from the inside out
I'd imagine he helps Luffy with Big Mom more than anything
Since that's his captain
It already does for me
I love literally everything about Big Mom
Even the amnesia bits are interesting
Pfft, I wouldn't even call it giving up zeph
Man just decided the fight went on long enough <:LUL:321931602655707136> bro gets tired y'know
Yep, presumably
Cept I doubt any of them will be bringing Yamato to Kaido
Yeeeh maybe
This won't be a strength thing tho, they need technique more than power
<@!274366418223497217> Y'know funny enough, katakuri and Cracker were the only ones who ever complained about how long it took Luffy to go down lmao
But
TO BE FAIR
They're also the only ones who've ever fought him for over 10 hours lol
Yeah, that's pretty perfect
Mayweather and Pacquiao again, or whatever that big fight of his was
But that's for <#513313452081545256>
Ancient zoans just recover extremely fast in general
And are especially durable
What's up reggie
<@!431406303798362123> So we're not going to ask questions like that around here
!standards
!whois 431406303798362123
!modlogs 431406303798362123
Well, he did knock an Emperor out, Laww <:LUL:321931602655707136>
But I guess he wasn't really giving it his all
<:ZoroNut:632474447462400010>
Lmfao that's a great way of putting it, I love it
Oh he knew, he notices she's fine right after that too
And promptly soils himself
lmao
He's only covered up two things for the goverment
What happened at Dressrosa never happened before because no warlord was found out besides Crocodile before
But also having said that, only Croc and Doflamingo were actually doing horribly illegal things
Had a dinosaur drop on her head and it *helped* her
!mamalogic
Did that not load for anyone else?
Nvm
The funny thing is Hawkins says the same thing later about Kaido
I love that it's a running theme that the emperors are particularly special pirates
Or they were such horrible losses and coverups that it was all he could take
He *may*  have had other things before, but he also doesn't seem too miffed about having to do stuff like that
Impel Down was one thing, that would lead to a whole new era of degeneracy revived
And cause such horrifying mass trouble that covering it up was a total, devastating loss for them
I could honestly see him wanting to resign just for that
Like, the level 6 prisoners didn't give a number, but apparently all of them were released (or killed by Blackbeard's crew) and just one could cause an entire country trouble
How could he face the problem?
Not like he could go out and track these dudes down himself
He's probably just got the dragon fruit
Especially since we know the ryu ryu no mi is a thing
Yeh, man was in his 70's and just fought a war that he barely managed to win without losing most of his marines
And on top of that, Blackbeard was born
And the New World was thrown into immediate chaos from Whitebeard's death, something sengoku knew would happen
Like honestly, just all of that all at once seems like enough to make a guy want to resign
yeh, his title is literally Hundred Beast Kaido, but contextually it's The Beast or King of Beasts
*The* Beast denoting that he's at the top of the food chain, so either way is accurate enough for me tbh
>losing several warlords
I forgot about this too
And even worse, two of them end up helping make the war worse than it needs to be lol
Drowning also just may not work on him
He could be some part fishman too
Oh yeh, they're not Spandam or anything
Jack's only fishman trait is his teeth tho
He doesn't seem to want to actually die, he seems to want something to kill him
Are you? I thought you were black lol
Kaido did let them go, Orochi didn't tho
<@!143219473585930240> Yeh exactly, that and his suicide stuff has never been mentioned again since
Even off handed comments
Makes me think he wants something flashy more than just death in general
It's a fox, so I assume he has to not have a fruit
Unless there's some other model or paramecia maybe that can let him change?
Guys, take those to <#164972407147200512>
Shit, that really was all in one week, LOL
Hell, wasn't that like 5 days?
>BB existing
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
Sakazuki really doesn't have that much to bitch about yet, all things considered
All that happened in a week, his troubles have been building up for a few months now lol
<@!377670308280139784> That user seems to be a particular problem, and this isn't really new it feels, would you consider a ban? Was it that bad?
I didn't want to be too draconic doing it, but I agree, I'd prefer less meaningless convo there
I'm gonna start recommending them speak in <#164972407147200512> or <#164970986284777473> if it gets either too off topic or too nonsensical about things that aren't strictly manga content
But, a second channel helps to alleviate some of that too. At least we can concentrate the problem to one channel instead of the other
<@!377670308280139784> Yeh I only bring it up because sidra was brought up as a problem with that not too long ago too
Like his people made it?
That'd be interesting strong
Might be what inspired Kaido to go for the weapons
At least, I hope he decided to do it because he had some actual info at first anyway
!modlogs 330375715247882240
Oh yeh, at this point since that's the second official warning they'd gotten, I support a ban for the next offense
Since it's for the same exact thing and it's been unofficially an ongoing issue with them
Doesn't seem like it, but they've been told about it in chat apparently
By multiple staff members, just the first official warning was a couple of weeks ago by Red
So definitely the absolute last straw here if it's getting to the point of insulting staff
I dunno if it was that far before since I'm not too active in <#206841928019476491> tho lol
No one despises the government
Not really
That's why they haven't taken them down, it wasn't until now that Big Mom and Kaido decided to get together and declare war on the world
*Now*, the government may be in trouble <:LUL:321931602655707136>
I'd like some kind of reference to Zephyr
Maybe he did or discovered something relevant to the present day
Doesn't even have to be a focus, just a quick mention
For sure doom
Yeh exactly, with all the extra stuff, lol
The admiral who trained the last generation of them
Hardly canon, I'm not sure if he's official
Oda designed him I believe, but it seems ambiguous
Tanu, Garp and Sengoku weren't the trainers for the marines, what's being taken from them?
Only people Garp have trained have been Luffy, Ace, Sabo, Helmeppo and Koby
They didn't care for them, but they weren't relevant beyond being in the way
Like, the government wasn't a target, they were just a thing on the seas
Unlike for the Revolutionaries or Luffy at Enies Lobby
It wasn't until Marineford, I imagine, that Whitebeard cared that the marines exist at all
Your diary.
probably not no lol
>Oars
>Ryuuma
Pretty strong <:LUL:321931602655707136>
It's like 838 or some such
But Jeff's probably right
Especially since Vegapunk helped discover it
It's probably come back up as something Vegapunk mastered, given his reputation
How is it bs?
Because the haki that the scabbards used is probably rare in the world
Yeah, that'll be a nice mystery to find out
Does the official say differently?
Yeh doen, that seems to be the case
Or, implied at least
>first time since Marineford that mass death is gonna happen
Did we forget about Punk Hazard, Dressrosa and potentially WCI?
Mass death happens a *lot* in this series lol
I never care about making a distinction between deaths in the present and in the past, it's honestly completely pointless to even make that divide
But having said that, there have been plenty in the present
the Bird Cage? No
Doflamingo tried to kill half the people in the country, and succeeded in a lot but not all
Yaaasss you've gotta make some small non descript video about it
It was stopped for about a second and took the entire country pushing against it to stop
for just that second
there's no evacuating from the bird cage unless you're Buggy
Because Caesar killed more than two people before present day Punk Hazard
That's smart, did you put a lever to wind it with the spindle?
In Impel Down, yeh
Into boiling blood
Recessive genes that are reactivated from the full moon
turning them feral and kicking their body into overdrive
Blood
Ace could've destroyed Magellan back then <:LUL:321931602655707136>
It was boiling enough to boil people to death, coded
Oh, I meant just because of the fire
Ace is immune to his poison 'cause it can't touch him, lol
Y'know, out of sea stone
Lmao haki poison, I love it
But nah I don't think that'll work, haki doesn't seem to prevent logia weaknesses from taking effect
Like with Katakuri at WCI
but hold that thought, break time soI'm gonna step out for a smoke
I need pictures of this someday ;-;
fon, you've got to appreciate good craftsmanship <:LUL:321931602655707136>
He does, but they're an anesthetic gas
It's an art that's almost a living philosophy for every single swordsman in Wano
It'd be weird if they couldn't use the same kind of haki as Oden
Kaido was drunk, defenseless and the samurai were using the kind of haki that can specifically harm him
Why wouldn't they be able to?
Why would it matter that he is?
Law hit Kinemon with something he's never seen before and left him in pieces
Of course he can beat him, just like he'd beat anyone who had no idea how his powers worked or how to defend
It's Ryuo, and while haki is a problem for him
that doesn't mean Kinemon knew that, or knew how to make it so that problem worked in his favor
He didn't even know what devil fruits were, they think it's just magic
Yeh, that's a big thing I noticed recently laww
and it explains why Wano specializes in it
Swordsmanship is a subtle art to master, not just chopping away at things with a katana
So it makes sense that Wano natives master it in particular
And Ryuo, while it is just armament haki, the higher forms involve a very nuanced technique
We can even see that with the way Luffy breaks Yamato's cuffs, it's nothing about brute strength at all, he has to slow down and relax into it
He does, yuka
And being a vice admiral would still be fine
First off, they're much stronger
but also, if a vice admiral could use that same level of haki, then they could hurt Kaido too
It's the technique, it's not power
I mean...this is a literal suicide mission
lol
Maybe
Not much moon related stuff that needs to be touched upon
Unless Sulong has something to do with history and not just genetics
You think Sulong is related?
Maybe, that'd be interesting
Oh, maybe, but I don't know
Also, it shouldn't be a surprise that this is how the raid is going
Oda already stated he didn't want Luffy to win just by having a stronger punch
So, we've got the amazingly subtle destruction of this new armament
Zeus can't do anything to Lufy
<@!420202273885519872> If you're still doing it in 3 hours, I may join in
lol
Is all good if not
Ay viri
Doctor's?
Ahhh, hope it's all good bud üëçüèæ
I've got that tomorrow myself, haha
There's also no telling if Kaido and Big Mom know enough about the new techniques that they can defend against them
Neither of them are really nuanced enough for me to expect it
Nor would they ever actually need them, lol
I'm alive, that's always good enough for me, lol
Lmao why thank you
You can find some very light free therapy online if you need, fon
Reddit has a lot of communities dedicated to mental health support, including chats
All he has to do is fly around a little
Kaido can take care of the moon easy
He can blanket the sky lol
Like, in seconds
He probably won't though
Yes, and maybe
They planned this specifically for the full moon
It's been a month
enel isn't an astronomer lmao
He has no idea how many  moons there are
He only knows what he can see
It was about a week to Wano, I wanna say
Maybe two
It was two weeks after Luffy landed on Wano that the raid started
So yeh, it's been about a month
Not months no
Maybe about a week or two before Luffy got there
WCI only took a week and a half to finish
A week to sail there, a couple of days there, a day to get out
Then on their way to Wano
Enel said he wanted to go to the Fairy Vearth
Which is whatever he decided it to be
Enel had a specific location, never "moon"
It was Fairy Vearth
Having multiple moons doesn't really cause any problems
They just say "moon"
^ The lack of plurals is something that has to be indicated
Sure he can spice
Just because there are multiple moons doesn't mean they're all prominent enough to either influence anything or be shown
Why would it be an asspull? It wouldn't affect anything
It doesn't matter if there are multiple moons or not if only one is out
Thing is, Oda hasn't really done any worldbuilding as far as that goes
It's not like this has been a massive subject for the series
It wasn't even really until now that we got characters who need the moon for something
Being massive to the fandom doesn't mean it's relevant to the series at all, druser
It wouldn't be that massive if it doesn't affect anything in the series tho
Unless it's actually important that there's only one moon, having multiple is irrelevant
It's just something some people like or dislike
No, if it doesn't affect *anything* in the series
I didn't say plot
Unless having multiple moons changes some part of the show, it's entirely irrelevant
Bruh I just said *everything*
I specifically didn't say plot lmao
Yeh druser, worldbuilding is actually used for plot here
Oda's not crafting WoW or anything
Yeh stoopid
now, something like saying there are two Gaon Cannons
That'd be important
Saying it's made of something besides Adam Wood, that affects things
There's about equal actually, alex
For it, we've only seen one
against it, we've seen the model
That's probably what it'll be King, lol
flying machine with nukes
there is a technology level in One Piece
It's the scale in relation to the Earth
There's a clear implication there
It's a scientific model
It's faaar more likely to be to scale than not
^
There's no applicable IRL reason for there not to be multiple moons
It really just comes down to a lack of active indication in the series vs portrayal
Oda could literally say they've only had one moon because the other 5 orbit the other side of the planet at the time
strong
Read that in the official lol
Because she didn't, she was deluded
And it's not an asspull if there's a foundation laid beforehand
Luffy didn't win because his will was too weak, he won because Moria lost his mind
He couldn't contain them because he was barely conscious and overflowing
Because he messed with his actual fruit
And broadened it
Much like how Caesar can use poison because of his own modifications
And other various things
<@!160778857702490113> Had a thought just now
Chopper and Caesar have directly affected and changed their fruit powers beyond their normal range
Do you think that would transfer over to the next host?
With Chopper's, they explain he actually distorts the power of the fruit itself to get his extra forms
Kaku was just abusing his biology
lol
Chopper actually went and changed his basic fruit power in general
Why wouldn't they be able to?
Well, I mean in general
Chopper's forms are just a natural part of his fruit now
Not just can someone else warp his fruit the same way, since anyone could do that if they're smart enough anyway
But if it comes pre-changed because of what he did to it
Yeh, the gears are just a technique
Chopper's changing his fruit's power beyond its norm
I'm wondering if next chapter will be the end of the act or anything
Or it they'll actually carry to the end of the raid
They don't make you sink, you jus tcan't move
Or, rather you're out of energy
Ye
Who says awakened abilities are unique?
So far that doesn't seem to be the case
In what universe? lmao
yeah, absolutely not
lol
Koby as a captain is not stronger than the entire Strawhat crew pre-skip put together
Like, i'm thinking maybe he takes down someone from CP9
*Maybe*
Butter is a paramecia <:LUL:321931602655707136>
That's even if koby can get to Hancock
This is still a whole ass nation, after all
