it's not canon
yeh Brook never fought Oven
lol
in the manga
Sanji has a couple of clashes
For all the zorotards, there's almost as many sanjitards as well
why does hardly anyone have an unbiased stance on these characters
yeh Wow not true
zorotards are just louder
there are plenty of sanjitards
trust me
that's actually kinda true
there's a lot of "zoro haters" here
lmao
JUST APPRECIATE BOTH CHARACTERS FOR WHAT THEY ARE
godam
zorotard, sanjitard, who cares ..... at the end of the day, they're just retards
"ideals"
lmao
Zeph wants to create a better world
but zoro haters get in the way
it's quite funny watching a hardcore zoro or sanji tard state their opinions
you think they're trolling
but they just aren't
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
omg I'm leaving
why
why
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
that is one of the worst things I've ever heard in my life
OK STOP
Milk moon
How has Zoro been portrayed close to Luffy at all?
Kidd has
Zoro is not stronger than Kidd lol
yes
discord is acting very weird
because a user actually thinks Zoro is stronger than Kidd
lol
oh come on
really
Zoro has green hair, Sanji has yellow hair, I prefer Green so Zoro > Sanji <:shutupretardstoptyping:736095674730414081>
how some of you sound
People are saying Zoro could‚Äôve beaten Doffy?
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
‚ÄúJoke‚Äù
It‚Äôs serious
Momosagi and Chaton
<:CobySalute:638916402467569675>
Youss, that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs hardly ever a meme
They‚Äôre just that stupid
Cuck?
FMI > Dressrosa
Obvs not
You need serious help if you think that
Not even Fuji
Doffy would‚Äôve turned him to mince meat
Favorite admiral
Propbably
I think there‚Äôs a reason there‚Äôs only human admirals
The only other race in the marines are giants iirc
Haha ace ded haha <:AkainuLUL:726025066361651281>
Big true swrml
<a:ZoroTatsumaki:485086475289886732>
The warlord system, while kinda stupid, was such an interesting concept. Love them
Not stupid as in I think it shouldn‚Äôt exist
Stupid as in, it was a very risky chance the marines took trusting some of the most dangerous pirates in the world
I love the idea
And yeh, it added many layers
And BB Bean
Buggy joining Shanks is pretty likely i think
Idk how else he‚Äôd escape the marines
Gonna eat brb
<:LUL:321931602655707136> <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Very true Archer
Just heard the Haikyuu dub
<a:PepePuke:654218964162838538>
Remember anyone can join, so having a few weird rogue users is kinda unavoidable
But eh

Props to u guys
Yeh that‚Äôs a real shame. Some people may get turned off by some random user who just joined just blurting random crap
OH HI MOE

I‚Äôm big dumb dumb
That would almost be as bad as #powerscaling
Power scaling channel would be funny af
I would never speak
Just lurk
And watch the chaos unfold
Manga is #powerscaling life

Would be funny af
Imagine bringing back #nsfw

Faction wars lol

Honestly I expected him to have taken a much longer break between the timeskip but Oda being the man he is, he only took like a month
Shit
Stop lying, there are no girls on the internet
<:shutupretardstoptyping:736095674730414081>
‚ÄúGirls‚Äù
It is honestly the most infuriating thing
You‚Äôre actually having a nice educated discussion
THEN BAM
Nsfw Luffy
Literally what happens
Then you get one white name ask some really uncomfortable lewd question
THEN BAM
Gets banned
I only leave manga when I feel like I‚Äôm losing an argument
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
<a:runningemote:735442727239417917>
when I don't know how to reply to someone's rebuttal, I do what they call a "get the fuck outta there"
honestly, discussing with people like Doom, Bean, Archer, Choc etc ... is a great way to keep the story fresh in your mind
luckily
I know more than all of them so
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
flowchart
the most accurate thing in the world
you used it against Doen?
it's very accurate
number 4
happens without fail
EVERYTIME
they also just become really cynical a start straw manning
if you're not a manga reader
you shouldn't be in this channel
no this is specifically for the ONE PIECE manga
I prefer b and w for practically all series lol
?
manga is all canon lol
marineford was filler
all of it
> For example, Katakuri fight had way too many interjections from other scenes. With anime, simple edits make the fight more fluid. <@!263517029284184064> you edit ur the anime yourself????
wtf
so am I, but I'm still dumb as shit
<:CrocoKidEvenMoreDistorted:586469633419378704>
this is bate
bait

<:shutupretardstoptyping:736095674730414081>
they're not gags
it's his character
he's a free spirited guy. Doesn't overthink things. Does stuff mostly off instinct and lets his guts and determination help him. He doesn't need to be this 400 IQ genius who's planned everything out
it's just an invalid statement
"sometimes"
you just joined
another speedreader looking at things so 1 dimensionally
I swear there is no nuance or thought to some people's opinions
wtf
why is it like speaking to toddlers
idk how to respond
stop saying things with no substance coz you can't be bothered to think a little deeper
lol
No, he asked you why you don't like certain things, and you basically answer with "coz I don't"
for all of them
It's not that we want in depth answers
**Please Read This** it's just really annoying to try to have a discussion with people who don't bother to delve a little deeper into the material and just look at things so one-dimensionally. It's not that you;re not allowed an opinion, it's just that your opinions are annoying for discussions coz they lack substance.
> Can yall shut up so I can see this discussion they are not answering yall <@!606196171307745308> this is the discussion
lol
move to Alaska
that is objectively wrong but whatever
that doesn't make any sense
manga sjw
Listen <@!742887438720172235> I really respect people having their own opinions. But this is a discussion channel. Saying you don't like something because of something as vague as "coz they're generic" adds literally **NOTHING** to the conversation. And only creates ranting like this.
and then it just divulges into back forth nonsense where the discussion can no longer proceed. If you wanna say a hottake, go ahead, but make sure you have actual substantial points so the conversation can **develop**.
lol Spice, one day my dream will come true
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
ok perfect timing, coz I have to walk the dogs
oh coz of pfp
I like Mai so I'll take that as a compliment
lol Albair
aight brb
aight I'm back
<a:pogdance:449705087124635668>
nah had to walk the dogs
don't start this again
lol
oh Lami's here
yo



Oda is actually the best omg
few others go put this much care into every single detail
the goat
it's an amazing ship what can I say
lol imagine, if Robin just told Luffy out of the blue, "oh btw, I met your brother Sabo, who you thought has been dead for the last decade." How do you think that would turn out lol
yeh exactly
what makes you think Luffy would believe/accept Robin
that's not something you just say
Fright, you seem to look at these things with a pretty closed mind without taking the time to consider other possibilities
stop dismissing things as stupid
just because you don't like them at first glance
saying "that's just logic" literally proves you don't look at things with an open mind
it's frankly just annoying, coz the discussion is forced to come to a halt
ok
please stop
no
there's a thin line between being a troll and just naturally being infuriating
no need
it's easier to separate someone's gender from them saying stupid thing
Robin is perfection
no
I will not be doing that
lol
it was about time
really?
that's true Discord
I always get suspicious when it says "I'm new to discord say hi"
you can't be that new surely
yep
> vegito called it like an hour ago <@!272064319661801473> the only thing Vegito has gotten right today
nothing
hopefully moving onto a more interesting discussion
no
I refuse for you to be new
We should have entry applications <:LULW:607641487429206106>
with really bizarre questions
yes
let me make an entry application
filter out the alts
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
yes, and the mods must council each other as to whether or not people are allowed to join
yes
red was the 5th member to join
I technically joined at the end of 2018 on another discord account. But I made a new account when I moved back over to the US. But I don't think I said anything back then so I don't really count it
I thought you joined in 2019?
oh
nvm
you can
this was your first comment
I started reading OP during Punk Hazard so ...
2011 or 2012 I think
idk
nice
search up your name
no
top right
search bar
if you're on mobile I can search it up for you <@!606196171307745308>
this is how many messages you've sent
yeh
I'm almost at 40k <:Uso:637751966184767546>
coz u turned off spoilers
probably
lol
wassup
<:Uso:637751966184767546>
yes I'm a dick
don't talk to me
500k just seems insane
Roro had over 400k as well
yeh
I think Moko has over 300k
iirc
badass
a video?
he made an entire video?
lmao

Killua
^
a hug
even better
I gotta get to 100k soon
so I can finally be free
<a:pogdance:449705087124635668>
invisible
I will bet you I hit 100k by the end of 2020
go full no life
doom has the most
active regular = too much free time
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
I'm free for the rest of the year
I'll hit 100k no problem
that's fair
that's a smart plan Strong
I like it
If I get banned I'll just make my own server called r/r/OnePiece
it will specialize in powerscaling
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
yeh he's from Charlotte
pretty cool
lol
what is this game
it's insane
Yeh screw Evan, hate that guy
such a loser
I'm so jealous of how smart and handsome he is
ugggh

<:LULW:607641487429206106>
I'm so glad he ended up in Portland
great fit for him
yes I'm called Henry
as well
for some reason
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
Juba, I'm rooting for you guys
dude
I'm actually scared
Blazers are a tough matchup
especially for first round
yeh, but I'd rather the first round be a cake walk
yeh we have our own set of problems to deal with lol
gdi, I miss Avery
could have helped subdue Dame a bit
insane game
sorry Hog
looks like Memphis are <:PES_HahaDead:585724566824026132>
if we can keep the series to 6 games or under
won't be too bad
7 would be a pain in the ass
I'm only here when I'm not here
I like that green yeh
but the cool kids use orange
<:PES_NotCool:643089267953762304>

<:NamiPray:661055694476410910>
I've got that covered
I'm the funniest person I know
<:ApooPoint:714023366356500531>
I agree, it‚Äôs really not that relevant. It‚Äôs not gonna make him live til 25 or something
If he ends up living to 60 who cares
He‚Äôs not
Spice, tag me in
It‚Äôs been on and off for me today fats
Are you on mobile?
King
Oh if MEE6 is down then yeh
But sometimes ! rank doesn‚Äôt work for me on mobile
That‚Äôs not what he‚Äôs doing at all
some guy is gonna have a nice surprise waiting for him <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Jinbe being with Luffy rn is probably the best thing for achieving his goal
Wait aren‚Äôt we all agreeing on the same thing?
Who‚Äôs the jinbe hater?
Oh
Nvm
Not meshing?
They all jumped on him when he returned
They seem pretty glad to have him on Bird
Bird
BAORD
BOARD!!!!
I think Jinbe is the best SH addition post ts
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
It was a joke
Oh ofc Laww
I don‚Äôt get the argument that Jinbe doesn‚Äôt fit in with the crew. I don‚Äôt mind people not liking Jinbe or wanting him. But I think it‚Äôs objectively wrong that he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúfit in‚Äù on the crew
Jinbei has had a pretty seamless transition imo
CaP
How is it cap
You personally not wanting him on the crew doesn‚Äôt make his transition not seamless
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
I think it‚Äôs pretty dumb to say he doesn‚Äôt fit in on the crew. It‚Äôs purely you not liking him and not looking at the situation objectively
Exactly as fats said
Being a goof and quirky doesn‚Äôt make you ‚Äúfit in‚Äù on the SHs
Jinbei has been the perfect addition to the crew imo
That‚Äôs why I could really care less who joins after
Yeh Laww
If I wasn‚Äôt on mobile rn I was gonna bring up that panel
A few people apparently
Which is fine
Yamato is the most likely candidate for ‚Äúnext sh‚Äù as of now
That‚Äôs if we even get one tbh
You said it doesn‚Äôt he doesn‚Äôt feel like a natural or seamless fit onto the crew. Which is pretty vague and really just translates to I don‚Äôt really want him on the crew. Because there is plenty of things that debunk that ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt fit‚Äù statement
Which is pretty arbitrary to begin with
Dying?
Lol
He‚Äôs also a chonky boi
Carrot: Annoying, smells bad, and causes allergies
Not my SH

I unbanned myself
Akainu had plot Armor??? <:LUL:321931602655707136>
I think the fact that he **did **survive, is more of a testament to his insane and comparable strength to yonkos, and less of "plot armor" lmao
yes
<:voulkhug:721081052596142090>
Buggy becoming this "legendary" pirate would be really funny and I hope Oda does it
it's already building up
but like we skip to 50 years in the future, and people are telling their grandkids about how powerful and legendary Buggy was even tho it's all bullshit
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
that would be great
<@!377670308280139784> she's mine
lmao Fuji, <:LULW:607641487429206106>
you do it, see if she's yours as well
just scroll up a little
HAHAHA, I did it again and got fucking Ricardo
what is this
Heaven you say <:LuffyThink:701983952482599032>
I can see that
yeh for the love of god
please don't make every ancient weapon inhabit a persn
1 is enough
we probably will know for sure
it's Akinator
Yamato is looking very very good right now
as in looking good to join
not literally looking good
but she is that as well
nvm
Usopp
"Readers can feel close to Usopp since he is not a strong crewmate." Here is the quote from oda so for the people who say he will suddenly become a "commander" for Luffy, I very much doubt it. (idk what a SH commander is lmao)
Chris Hanson server lmao
Zeph has immunity from bans
Haikyuu will be at the top forever coz it's the best <a:TendouYess:666176413698621470>

wait what happened to #alsomanga
??
yeh, I think it will most likely be his one piece design
Sanji level?
is that a thing
lol
Luffy was about to be forced into G4 if it wasn't for Yamato
literally says it
you always arrive during prime shitpost hours

<:PES_ReeCowboy:585724569617170432>
*insert ecstacy of gold"

I remember reading that in my textbook when I was a youngin
Western outlaws were notorious for their meticulous craftsmanship of stone cubes
fleebs just reacted with <:ZoroNut:632474447462400010>  before he even said anything
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
wait someone said the one-shot takes place in Wano??

gdi Marc
smarts or intelligence is a very vague term
obvs Luffy is an idiot. But he also isn't in many regards
same can be said with Robin
<:shutupretardstoptyping:736095674730414081>

If he doesn't like your names, **he gives you a new one**
Chad
Doen ur a doodoohead

that's tough
she was probably let go as well

Afraid?
Akainu just becomes twice as powerful once he gained the ‚Äúfleet admiral‚Äù title <:LUL:321931602655707136> <:LUL:321931602655707136> <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Hello hello
Coz people are illiterate nowadays
Lol
Me too Pasto
One in Minnesota actually
<:ApooPoint:714023366356500531>
My boy
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
How would it tho
When admirals are the ones who‚Äôre promoted
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
Yeh its not stated anywhere that the strongest admiral gets the job lol
Omg stop powerscaling!!!
<:CrocoDurr:663850964763279381>
We literally see it make shock waves
Lmao
No
It‚Äôs an amazing fruit yeh
Stupid question Choc
Expecting people to understand basic premises
Lol
> didn't mother caramel imply that fleet admiral is stronger than an admiral when talking about lilin's potential ? <@328936254978916352>  here
Lol
Kinda got
^
They ‚Äúmade‚Äù them fight lmao
I agree
||I‚Äôm not actually enjoying this arc as much as I thought I would|| MHA latest chapter
‚ÄúCut out to be‚Äù
Didn‚Äôt say ‚Äústrong enough to be‚Äù
All it meant was that she had the potential to rise to the top of the ranks
No
That‚Äôs coz Carmel didn‚Äôt know what the fuck she was talking about
I guess I do <:shutupretardstoptyping:736095674730414081>
ALL THE ADMIRALS ARE ALREADY FUCKING STRONG
strength isn‚Äôt the problem here
Literally all it is
Ugh some of you power scaling junkies can be so brain dead sometimes
Literally means the same thing
Strength has nothing to do without, because all the candidates are ALREADY FUCKING STEONG
OMG
The candidates are already admirals
WTF
you're implying the strongest admiral must become fleet admiral
Obvs no one fucking thinks T-bone could become fleet admiral
you implied that the fleet admiral position is chosen with strength as a factor
when that is not true at all
EXACTLY
Vegito, you're contradicting yourself
But Vegito
The candidates are already admirals
I know, but out of the admirals
"the strongest" one isn't instantly chosen to become Fleet admiral
Vegito
If the admirals, who are all freakishly strong, are the only candidates. Strength should not be the main issue. BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY STRONG.
yes but, when the gorosei or whoever decides who they want to promote out of the admirals, they don't go "I wonder who has the biggest dick and can blow the most shit up, we should choose that guy"
but the "Luffy" part is already established in all the admirals
it's whether or not they have the "nami" part
<:SengokuPalm:701663557338529802>
yes
strength isn't a factor anymore when you're already the strongest in the marines
<:CrocoDurr:663850964763279381>
for family?
he wacked Stelly in the face coz he was annoying
literally violating his duty
Garp actually cares about protecting the peace
he's actually a very idealistic guy
for the marines
he just doesn't care for the CDs or nobles, because he understands that they can get in the way of peace
but that's kinda redundant when the candidates are literally ones who already have that strength
people like T-bone aren't even considered
spandam isn't part of the marines
Lucci doesn't respect Spandam at all
Dragon's gonna have a very interesting backstory
you don't think we'll get one?
<:FujiWoke:638345772953370624>
I'm just counting down the days until my Luffy, Dragon, Garp teamup panel
it will happen

<a:REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEGIF:393866924192432158>
Akaii, I will make it happen
idc who it's against or where it is, or how long it lasts
I just want 1 panel
<:NamiPray:661055694476410910>
yeh I'm banking on Imu being a woman as well

Choc shut

Monkey D. Kong
I can't believe people think that
that's the only reason
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
are you responsible for this Choc
<:BennGun:670691867620409359>

I appreciate that fon
well his family do have it
what just happened?
ha Lami
she's dead
<a:aPES_Laugh:664885767574781964>
Cora should've lived and Law should've died
oh god
Rocks D Nami
do people think that?
god it gets worse by the day
Usopp for sure isn't a D
I doubt Nami is but she has more of a case than Usopp even if the chances are practically 0
<:FujiWoke:638345772953370624>
no Akaii
I need to check
We DoN't KnOw HeR rEaL pArEnTs
<:shutupretardstoptyping:736095674730414081>
Zoro is more likely to have CoC than Nami is to be D lmao
yeh that's so weird Viri, you and me literally have the opposite situation
didn't you say your parents wanted you to be in finance or something
wow fate
what's it like
Zoro has very powerful coc
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
LOL
Zoro is literally powered by his fanboys
deal
mochi is the only one
Yeh she's half Charlotte, Half Monkey D. (BM and Dragon) Charlotte Monkey D. Nami
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
I'll burn them first
gdi YC
Water doesn't mean anything, Oda probably just wanted it to sound like Waterloo
yeh
isn't that actually a theory YC?
Brook and Kuzan
Every stupid theory has a couple of retards behind them, just gotta know where to look
that's one of the most infuriating things to hear honestly
I love this panel coz it briefly makes you think Rocks was some midget when its actually just everyone else is 20 ft tall
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
Of course they would Viri
Roger was 9 feet tall so I'd say around there
not Kuma lol
what makes you say that??
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
<:ShanksYes:727411684095819856>
If you're not 9 feet tall, ur midget in one piece
<:CrocoDurr:663850964763279381>
> Tsuru is as tall as LeBron <@!439770223944400896> that's cursed lmao
Sizes in one piece are gret
Merry the midget
that's good logic
I really doubt they'll be explained
it's just to add to the mystery and world of one piece
<@160778857702490113>
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
ofc
I think so
Yasopp will just reply to Usopp telling him she's dead with a simple  "oof"
Crocomingo
no fake bullets either, none of that p*ssy shit
real bullets
I still think BB will kill Shanks so Yasopp getting killed could happen
not Mihawk
lol fagu
ok his whole crew doesn't have to be massacred lmao
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
<:BBZehahaha:586271941627871234>

Sanji is fighting Avalo Pizarro in my head canon

that's a good point Dora <:LULW:607641487429206106> <:LULW:607641487429206106>
<:CrocoDurr:663850964763279381>
ofc Doom
and Doom
Sanjuan Wolf is only YC7 level
<:CrocoDurr:663850964763279381>
ok let me see if I remember this
1. Burgess 2. Shiryu 3. Augur 4. Pizarro 5. Lafitte 6. Devon 7. Sanjuan 8. Vasco Shot 9. Doc Q
I believe that is which commander runs which ship
someone check
oh lol ofc
make it happen
<:MoriaWide:625735023668232202>
Oda missed his chance to make the shadow on the water Moria
Oda is such a bad writer smh
<:Uso:637751966184767546>
yeh that is kinda strange
I wanna see what interaction went down
ok let's talk about that for a sec
Was that actually Hawkins
yeh
that's my thinking
how could it be hawkins
Caribou is 100% the shadow that was following Jinbe and robin
I've confirmed it
Franky and Brook
there's no way this is Hawkins yeh
YES
coz it's happening Doom
it's happening
The prophecy
smaller
I think
coz they Kid said Hatchi or whatever his name was looked taller than giants
yeh
yeh Arsal
I sorry
Weren't they meant to come round the side like a pincher formation?
the back was the scabbards and Law's group
Good morning
I love that aspect of the plan
it's only to get to Kaido and BM successfully
still kinda confused as to where Zoro and Kidd are
they're still in front of the dome right?
oh below
yeh idk why I said BM
no
Idk what else people want tbh
people think that  if the allies suffer a major casualty/tragedy the raid is a failure
like no
it's only a failure if they're wiped out
yeh you're right it's just semantics and technicalities and certain people want certain things. At the end of the day, the only certainty is that the allies will end up winning
failing and them having to regroup and form an entirely new plan would be a huge waste of time and investment
I agree
but then why "kill" him in the first place
I guess Higurashi thought he would do something useful with it
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
that's a good point
yes Doom, but I feel like bringing him back would be **very high risk**, and a decent reward ig. There aren't many routes Oda could take with Orochi now that I can think of, that would one, make sense, and two, feel worth the trouble of bringing him back
I would hate that
shock factor for the sake of it
yeh, he didn't have to work very hard let's say that
lmao
I'm very on the fence about the whole Orochi "death" situation
<a:7860_bob_danceing:738791613446488078>
I'm hungry
many things
the funny thing is Moe, I feel asleep, at like 9, woke up at like 1 or something, and literally the minute after you went to bed, I came back online
me?
yeh kinda atm
that's a very useful skill to have
Fon the funny thing about opinions, is they're opinions
other than a few exceptions
one's is never better than the others
ADEMAS
bullying people into liking something is a very good tactic
if anyone bullies me join in
yes

so I've seen him

Berserk 176, <@!373144491005313025> ||ok, I'll give you my thoughts on the arc as whole soon, but just a tiny bit confused on a few things (If they are explained in the future you don't have to tell me). Okay first: How was the demon child of Guts and Casca protecting her this whole time? And secondly, how did the egg of the perfect world somehow turn that child into Griffith. Is it because Griffith tainted it when he raped Casca or something?||
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
lmao
oh I drew that Doom icon
ugh Berserk is too good
but yeh just gotta keep reading
thank you tho
Berserk 176 Conviction Arc "Review" ||This was easily another 10/10 arc but I'll try to go in order because there was a lot of material lol  **Lost Children**: I'm assuming most people think of Birth Ceremony when they think of Conviction, but I still really enjoyed Lost Children as an "isolated" story. Felt very fantastical and mystifying which I really enjoyed. Really nice themes of innocence, naivety vs reality, abandonment and what "home really is". Also nice take on the "mystical fairy trope". Really felt like a twisted fairy tale.  **Birth Ceremony**: This was peak manga, comparable to the second half of GA. The writing, art, themes, characters, and ending were all perfect imo. Really enjoyed returning to Rickert and Godo at first. Godo's speech to Guts when he was dying in his bed was amazing. Miura is clearly reinforcing the idea that Guts is **human**. In such a dark and fucked up word, he feels fear, anger, vengeance, etc. I love how he called Rickert and Casca irreplaceable, but then comes to the realization that he actually abandoned those things to sate his uncontrollable rage. Guts is becoming one of my all time favorite protags. The Holy Iron Chain Knights were pretty cool. I really like Serpico and feel like he will be much more relevant down the line. This seemed like setup for Farnese's character and I can see her having a lot more development soon. And Azan is Azan. Isidro is the fucking man. Perfect "sidekick" character. Robin to Guts' Batman. Mozgus was an amazing villain. Religion is always a cool aspect to explore in fantasy stories and I thought Miura wrote Mozgus's obsessive religious zeal perfectly. I was really intimidated and honestly creeped out by him. Felt like this actual threat that couldn't be reasoned with even before he gained powers. Then of course, the fucking ending. Running out of characters so, yeh just perfect ... again.||
ok fuck
ran out of space
lol
LOL, ||nah I just kinda chucked it in with Birth Ceremony coz it was only 8 chapters or something|| Berserk
yeh, it's definitely one of those series you could write an essay on

So Monster Point chopper should actually be taller than BM
yeh so Monster point is definitely taller than BM I'd say

I play piano, guitar, (violin), and a tiny bit of the french horn lmao
I only feel confident in piano and a little bit of guitar
yeh same
Piano is the only one I'm decently competent in
I play guitar for fun mainly
self taught
Self teaching myself guitar was actually really fun
but yeh, Piano is my main thing
and even then, I'm sure fats and Juba are much much better than me
something like that fate
left hand was my greatest enemy for years
genius
