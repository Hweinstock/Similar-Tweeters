I still support laww for it
no
Quite a bit under it
!standards
Srsly stop with the weird sex shit
He didn't get curb stomped by Whitebeard because Whitebeard didn't really fight him
He *did* get curbstomped by Roger
lmao
not very hard no
Ehh I doubt it
he still calls himself the mightest power
she was yeh, not an apprentice tho
She was there
That's about it lol
Yeh maybe
Might've even done him a favor later on to help him grow to power
Yeh, but 20 years later and marco's only a commander
while Kaido's the strongest thing walking the earth
...or flying, or swimming
Presumably he's just under the crew in general
Nah, they're perfect
New chap link guys ^
Nicer translation for sure
Thanks to juba for this one ‚ù§Ô∏è

<@!415999229564157955> Well that was Queen saying it, so should it be foddery?

I meant this bit
Which one were you talkin about?
Oooh, I was looking and totally skipped over that
Oh yeh, you're right
Another Emperor
<:CrocoKid:487633532907159552>
Boy how about that One Piece
This sounds like a whole lot of <#164970986284777473> talk
In fact, let's move it to <#164970986284777473>
!modlogs 508883871119572992
Yes we do
His fruit generates clouds
That's why most of the time he's flying around, presumably, he's got a full sky of them
Yep, it makes clouds
^
Yes, Kaido creates clouds
Goddamn lmao
Yeh juba, Big Mom does it with Zeus and Prometheus flying around together
Wilhelm, she already has
Big Mom making a storm seems to be a signature thing for her
Kaido does make clouds, and he does use them to fly
Reportedly the same way as Momonosuke
But, Oda hasn't really displayed it that way yet
No, those are his clouds
They are clouds yeh
Hang on

lmao
I'm sure they'll be able to use it for a good hour or so
Given that they're doing this specifically with the intent to die for it
I have no doubt they'll try to keep going while the other minks fall out
Kaido's never done lightning, but he does do clouds
His first appearance, he blanketed the sky over
Just like the natural byproduct?
Yeh probably
Especially since it seems to be storming already outside of Onigashima
It does
We see that happen with Roger and Whitebeard
they cause a storm on their island basically

In series confirmation about Kaido basically being able to coat the whole sky in clouds
Potentially, but I can also see Kaido just letting them change too
Turn them back
The form is only active if you're looking around during a full moon
It's the light that does it
so they just close their eyes and they're fine

Oda's knocked it out of the park with these, archer
all arc
It's snowing, godzilla
That's their gamble, blix
Having said that, this is still an Emperor known for being basically a juggernaut

Can we ban this guy? Maybe it's just me, but I see nothing but these kinds of weird ass shitposty messages, and half the time he derails a convo doing it
!modlogs 282705264862560257
!ban 282705264862560257 Degenerate behavior and constant derailing of conversations with weird sexual remarks or general shitposting
üëçüèæ
<@!277922292556890112> Sorry, but we only allow english here. There's a french server in <#357665389859307520> though
üëçüèæ
Course he hasn't, that's why he had to stop and focus when he helped yamato
But, I can see him being proficient in it for now
Given that he had been trying to learn this for 2 years and just only now got a teacher to help him do it
!ban 277922292556890112 Non-english speaker
Who tf is Marco gonna betray?
Well, that is what he declared he was going to end up doing
so it's either that or Marco's chasing him
Lmao, no goddammit
<@!274366418223497217> The mark thing, YEEESSSSSS. So fucking hyped. I love that every single thing he reads just gets better and better
Luffy wants to grab Momo, but I imagine we'll see the start of the Big Mom fight by next chapter
I hate that term so much
but it's not wrong
why would their strength matter?
Switching their personalities would make things worse for everyone
As far as we ever saw, it was just his fruit gaben
Though the fandom did assume he used haki as well since Vergo was
No see
the problem is there's still Kaido's body and powers to deal with
And his entire crew is built on power hungry failures trying to climb up
You're basically saying give a nuke to a psycho
Yes, when he uses his Room for too long and runs out of stamina, it starts draining his life instead
But that would be bad tho
Kaido not being in control of his body means someone potentially *worse* than Kaido in control of his body
The only people he could possibly switch with would be a random entirely unaffiliated samurai
Kaido isn't immortal
he *was* invulnerable
Up until he met samurai lmao
Big Mom was born with steel skin
Kaido seems to just be a beefcake, and apparently his fruit helps
We really don't, we just know a good bit
but none of it would affect things like Big Mom or Kaido are
He's not going to lose from ptsd lmao
Lmao, I think red gave up on getting me to read Haikyuu <:LUL:321931602655707136>
I gave it an honest try
They're also not making their skin invincible, nor is it
It's just naturally that way
and Kaido seems to just be powerful, not a skin deep strength
OH I DID NOT
Let me get right on that
good breakfast tunes
UGH I can't believe I forgot
I was so happy getting off of work
Later bud
I'm almost done with Heatwave
20 seconds in and I could tell this was ***fire***
When Whitebeard fought
The *world* was in danger
Yeah, I'd celebrate him dying too
For sure <:KuzanWoke:553336814660878336>
<@!420202273885519872> Just started Dreamland, still lovin it
Whitebeard was also an Emperor, and would've caused *tons* of widespread damage and panic with just about everything he did
Hell, fighting with Roger changed the weather and tore apart an island
No wait, lemme rephrase
*Hitting* Roger did that
One time
I was looking at that one, I used to love that show as a kid too lmao
I just put it on, and I am loving it so far
Oh hell yeah, this is great
It feels like Eminem and the Weeknd did a song with Pharrell and Daft Punk
This is definitely a jam
almost dislocating, not breaking
So I've heard Heatwave, Space Ghost Coast to Coast and Waterfalls Coming Out Your Mouth
100% hit rate so far, lol
Yeh, they always hit it out of the park
There were a couple I liked less on How To Be a Human Being, but I still iked all of that one too
Oh for sure
I still need to listen to that one too,The Strokes new album
He can do it, blueline
Oh dang, I'm hyped for it then
I just got to Melon and the Coconut, I see what you say about the guitar
This album is my new stoner album, I swear hahah
It's so chill but still such an upbeat jam
I just had some raisin bran and a banana
And now, poptart <:ZoroNut:632474447462400010>
Oh yeh, they're really unique with that
Their music is like listening to happy velvet
Gaben, fishman island was a necessity
Elbaf will be a side adventure unless they find some reason to go
mkay
I just got to Tokyo Drifting, it sounds so different but still hits
Usopp wants to go to Elbaf and Luffy has friends there
That is 100% the only reason they need to go
Denzel Curry on this one omg
He hasn't really used *any* technique since then
His only fight since was a quick run through of some fodder and an entirely offscreen bout with the gifters, lol
<@!420202273885519872> So I finished it, and much like totallynotmark, pretty much everything kept getting better as I listened
I'm gonna have to give it another go around in a bit so I can pin down my favorites
<@!372464153480134666> neerrrrrrrdddd
<:CrocoKid:487633532907159552>
Pretty much the same, but I'd replace Dreamland with Heatwave so far
I'll see how I feel after the second one tho
Batchee, now hush
Oh y'know what, Melon instead of Heatwave
Definitely
Because the bug was named and he died
Who could forget Batchee?
<:CrocoKid:487633532907159552>
Milk girl?
From Ace's thing?
I don't remember rofl
That break down was pretty great tho, favorite part of the song lol
It opens like a song from the Eagles, but then the bass hits and it's like
strap me in bb
SHANKS LOLOLO
That'shilarious
Shanks clashed evenly with the two strongest people in the world, pendas
>no showing of power
Clashed evenly
with the two strongest people in the world
lmao
<@!629040165750571038> Yeah, that doesn't happen here. And please reach out if it does, we'll hop right on it
üëçüèæ
Chopper's never lost a fight in Monster Point I'm pretty sure
When has he gotten shit on?
What about him?
Chopper didn't use monster Point against Enel
Oh yeh, Denjiro too lol
!whois 348674121934045185
Fishmen at Fishman Island
Homies and Big Mom at WCI
You're all wrong because Sabaody is the best pre-skip arc <:CrocoKid:487633532907159552>
Top 1
With honorable mention also being Sabaody
Sabaody ft. Sabaody
The best series in the arc
Before Whole Cake, I honestly like WCI the most I think
It's a hard tie
*akshually*
Zou did have skirmishes <:CrocoKid:487633532907159552>
And a small war
One of the biggest tearjerkers for me is actually a happy moment
When Dressrosa is freed and Kyros goes from smiling ear to ear and breaking down and full on ugly crying
Just because of how happy he is
gets me every time
I have something for you kamui
hang on

!modlogs 573258353879547926
<@!573258353879547926> English only pls
Yeh zeph, that's another one that gets me too
Another super happy moment
The Kyros one will still hit me like no other tho
Just the weight of it slamming into him all at once
I gotta get the pages
Oh fuck yeah, when Jinbe signed on in Impel Down to basically die for Luffy I liked him
But what made him nakama to me
Is when he hands Luffy the den den mushi to speak to Bon Clay one more time
This lady used to make really decent One Piece AMV's with some songs I liked
But she was horribly full of herself and such an ass
But I can't find the ones I used to like either, lol
An extremely underrated moment that the dub nailed perfectly
"Death is not an apology!"
I don't think enough people appreciate the fact that Brook lived through Luffy's greatest fear and is still an amazing person
The ones Nekomamushi talked about? They're from Zou
Even when getting wailed on by Nami yeh
One of my favorite moments is when he depresses himself in film Z, lmao
Jinbe and Brook, two best strawhats
üíØ
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-XrB5VJ20g
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wve7Y8mC2fw
Little humor to lighten things up
This is the dub version of it
How is Luffy's not sad?
He lost his best friend
And he almost died and got his mentor permanently disfigured because of his stupidity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btS55sqgR9E
I love Brook and Chopper's interactions
They don't happen enough
But this shit was hilarious, even in the dub
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uH546_LM-9I
zeph
Fujitora comments about that
when he, Doflamingo and Law are on Green Bit, just before the asteroid crashes
If you want to grab a specific panel for it
no, I mean specifically the name Joker
Fujitora asks about it, indicating they don't know
^ It's a server event
She doesn't want to kill them after
By complete and total accident
It's also a royalty thing, anaum
I think Oda was going for a bit of both there
About 2 minutes till episode stream
Stream in about 2 min if anyone's interested
Tonight's anime ep
They can't buster call totto land or Wano
Damn this opening is fire
I missed it last week
https://angelthump.com/onepiecediscord
<@!510934064610541580> We're pretty lax, just don't spoil in the wrong channels or do anything overly crass or offensive, keep those as a good rule of thumb and it's all good üëçüèæ
But also the actual <#456573949120217089> , lmao
The Strawhats couldn't overcome it at all lol
They escaped because Sanji is incredibly clever and was in a good position
I was expecting a gag there
like Zoro just commenting on the sake being empty or something
You can give it willingly too
;-;
LOL
What's this? The anime admitting Zoro is *not* the vice-captain? <:CrocoKid:487633532907159552>
Tottoland is very much safer than Zou
Just barely, but Big mom trumps just being hard to find
I love everything about Hyogoro in the anime
!modlogs 546182530148335656
!standards
<@!546182530148335656> Let's not do stuff like that
wooo
Kaido's been caught and imprisoned already
He just broke out
It's hard to destroy paper
It's waterproof
and fireproof
It's very hard to destroy
Well, besides just like cutting and tearing it
Being underwater was just fine for it
Zoro didn't shoot out armament haki lmao
Vivre cards aren't indestructible
They can be torn and cut lmao
They're just waterproof and fireproof
The thing he's been shooting out since Skypeia, air
Yes, a slash imbued with haki
Not the way you'd say there, no
No, we're talking about a very specific thing here lol
Your image there implied that cut was the same as what Luffy used on a tree in Wano, it was not
Sure, Zoro shot out armament haki
He did not use the form of it that hyogoro tried to teach Luffy
It wasn't even haki shimon, Mihawk has to teach him how to use it during the time skip
It's just the same philosophy
I guess technically? Not the way it's talking about, but sure rofl
Did you not see the rest of the image? lmao
roaches cannot survive nukes
A roach can survive radiation fallout, nothing is living through a nuke lol
If something *can* survive a nuke
There is no world where you're beating it with a sandal lmfao
Lots of things have survived from that time
Yeh, fishmen can't drown
Why is that such a shocking thing to state?
Yes, because he couldn't move at all without it
Because he has no energy to move in the water
He wasn't in any danger of drowning at all
the World Serpent being the Red Line would be great
More so if Elbaf's general inhabitants have a specific legend or reason to want to take it down
And just live without doing it for the sake of some established peace or something
Should be out some time soon, if it's on schedule
We'll link to it when we get it
Appearance has rarely played a part in it for this series tbh
Lola didn't marry him because he wasn't her type or some such
It'll probably be a gag tbh
He might be, yeh
Shanks may have no relation to Elbaf at all
No, the theory is that shanks will be on Elbaf because he doesn't seem to be coming to Wano, and there aren't too many islands between Wano and Laugh Tale <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Shanks has never had anything to do with honor in the same sense, I hope that isn't the common tie here
Process of elimination
That was the first reason
Everything else is just justifying that elimination lol
That's...so loose
The Red Force being more Viking looking is a good bit of connection, that's about it for me tbh
Everything else is loose and doesn't even apply to Shanks for the most part
The honor bit, I have no idea where that's coming from
Inb4 Oda just tells us Roger really wants scrambled eggs from this bird who lays giant eggs, but shiki interrupted their breakfast <:LUL:321931602655707136>
I would love that, pasta lmao
They're not coated in haki
Because they're weird and Oda took hundreds of chapters to mention them again
The egg was never even mentioned, it's just there
They may be, or some other thing related to the swordsman, but they're not in a constant state of coating
Otherwise no swordsman who can raise it would ever need to imbue their blade again
That can't be Uranus, Roger never got an ancient weapon lol
Or endangered, probably yeh
<@!628142565496979467> Because we just had a flashback to the height of his piracy, and we know the weapon he encountered
Yes, he did
Poseidon
Not Uranus
10 years from there, king
No, there was specifically a mention that he had
And we know the weapon that was meant for now
He didn't read all of the poneglyphs and was never interested in the weapons
Why would he know?
Roger was one of the two strongest dudes walking the planet
The man *is* the weapon lmao
13 years before, sure lol
Roger's illness didn't affect him at all unti ljust before he hits Laugh Tale lol

As we see here, they had no interest in the weapons
Did it have to be, tanu?
No naism, that's not implied at all
And Rayleigh directly states they don't care for the weapons
He was about 10 years from it, it naything
At *least*
What does that have to do with him finding the ancient weapons?
<@!628142565496979467> You're operating on a lot of baseless assumptions here
We don't even know what One Piece is, let alone that it can be used at all
It's not impossible, but given what we've been told
between his entire lack of interest in having the weapons, his flashback, and the actual ancient weapon identified for us
Odds are, he did not have any of them and only knew about Poseidon specifically
>*just* creating a new age of piracy
Come on tho
The weapons, beyond Shirahoshi, have never even been important
As far as the main plot goes, that is
If Roger had all 3, it wouldn't even matter to use
Shiki says he found a weapon, but that was also before they got Oden to Fishman Island so it wasn't Shirahoshi
There's a One Piece chat going on, come on
!modlogs 289876647354826752
^
That was before he knew about Poseidon
About exactly one weapon, yes
The location of which, not that he had it
Or, he just found out where it was and left it in place
Might be yeh
No, we saw everything that happened the year after that event
We saw everything about the year after that, yes
While it's sad that she decided to give them to the government instead of giving them to families
That's about...literally the worst part about everything she did, and nothing else
Just that they went into government service instead of a family
She didn't promise them a bad life or anything
John Giant's a vice admiral with a LOT of clout in the marines
And getting to protect the Celestial Dragons is actually one of the highest stations in the world
Government service can be a bad life, it isn't for everyone
Or even for most, it seems
In fact, marine service is the potentially bad one, working for the government seems to be where it's at
No no, we're not going to slap a triggering label on it and simplify her character to just that
She raised them in an incredible loving home and was seen as a saint to the public
Yes, she gave them up to government service, and that sucks
But she also raised them in the only loving home they'd ever had and treated them perfectly
No, that's a fact. She was not abusive to those kids in any way, at all
She kept them safe, kept relations with Elbaf okay, and gave them a home
Ya'll are assuming a lot about the future of these kids when the only one we know about made it big
Or....they're also vice admirals
Seeing as they were marines in One Piece
Or, y'know, government big wigs
Did she prevent any of their dreams, curiosity?
...no?
Oh sure, all but one of them died horrible deaths
Lmao, those don't count
That wasn't Caramel at least
<@!153450639924396032> You're gonna have to stop those weird exaggerated takes
I'm not assuming none of them did, i'm not assuming one way or the other
You're jumping to the conclusion because it makes Caramel looks worse
That's not weight to the discussion, that's just trying to shame her more lol
And every single one of them dies?
All but one, just automatically, no hope at all?
You weren't saying some of them die
You were trying to paint it like all of her kids were getting sent to a death camp
I never said it was right, wow
She, and yes she was
None of what caramel did was slavery, what?
Yes, into jobs
Yeh dax, what she did wasn't good
And I never said it was, or that she was a good person for it
But she didn't treat the kids poorly, and while it is unfortunate that she dealt with child trafficking
Literally all she did was give orphans government jobs for 50 years
No, one was a marine
We don't know what the rest do, she didn't just sell them all into the military
And she doesn't sell people to be fodder, she gives them up to be particularly great government workers or marines
You're right
she also didn't sell slaves for basic jobs
She gave up kids who had the potential to be great marine officers or high ranking government officials
This has nothing to do with law
It is until monday, yeh
It isn't even forced labor
She was selling them into *jobs*
Like, when we think of human trafficking IRL, naturally it'll get a backlash because people aren't being sold into potentially better lives than they ever could have had
No Wow, it's going by the manga
She doesn't sell people to be lowly classes
She gave up only the ones she thought would be the big winners
She wasn't just selling grunt work to the government and marines
This wasn't Disco at Saboady
Yeah, that's the worst thing about it naism
Only two, zeph
Since we don't know snack's thing, lol
Cracker and Katakuri were weak to water
Smoothie powered up with it
so only two
He might be able to more yeh, but she can also potentially hurt him more if he throws water at her
Caramel never abused Big Mom, actually
She didn't get the chance to
All Big Mom ever knew was her to be a loving mother and nothing else
Until Linlin munched on her
I mean yeh, lmao
Liatris, this isn't willful ignorance, it's nuance. If you can't see past just the label, you don't have to be part of the discussion, but it can't just end at "She did a crime, it's the worst thing ever"
But you're not gonna get disrespectful about it, that's for sure.
After HOURS, I'd love that, lmfao
No one's saying she's good, no
She's just not Satan incarnate
Nope, never once naism
All I said was she gave the kids a safe and loving home, which was true. It's shitty that she sells them later
But even when she does, she's selling them into full paying government jobs
Like...this is probably the best case scenario of that kind of situation
Wow, I have the pages
I'm reading them now
And you're gonna have to acknowledge this

>She is not a good person
<@!683663101186277416> Bruh. Who said otherwise?
^
She's not in a gray area, she's selling kids. But, she's also giving them a good home and putting them in government jobs
You're making it sound like they're concentration camps, wow
I'm not saying it's the best thing ever, but they're getting presumably full benefits, a paycheck, and a lifelong status that will do nothing but benefit them potentially
Now, if they go to the marines
That's when it'd be worse, but even then
Still government support and a paycheck
It's not that what she did is good, or that she was a good person
nor was that ever my point
Mkay, so let's keep them orphans
'Cause we've seen how orphans turn out in this series
Just so much  better, right?
Yes, lmao
waaaaaaaaaay more
We've seen so many more pirates hurt their people than marines hurt theirs, come on
<@!131218004540129280> IRL, yeah
For sure
In One Piece, there may legitimately be no difference in a lot of place slol
When I said my bit up there, I was thinking of Whitebeard for example
Liatris, nothing to do with it
You're totally misunderstanding my comment there
Whitebeard's island, Sphinx island
Was devastated because of a lack of government support, and was filled with orphans
Caramel not doing what she did could have been just as bad as her doing what she did, except now she guarantees the kids get *some* form of support that isn't someone like Streussen coming along
One Piece isn't that organized
Tbh if she ran a legit orphanage, she'd have no resources to actually help the kids lol
She'd only be able to take people at face value
It's not, but running it on your own outside of any form of government support is wow
Especially in the New World, on an island basically nowhere
Her devil fruit requires her to take the souls of other things to do that, wow
No, she couldn't have leased out much work
Unless she was gonna get people  to donate their lives for her assistance, lol
So she'll just give up her life instead?
Not at all, I just didn't think she'd kill herself to make ends meat
But sure, she could make homies out of her presumably much shorter span now, since she's also older
The farfetched bit about it is how she'd make it, wow
Big Mom is a freak of nature
Where would she get the life span?
Hers?
Unless she can recycle and bring it back in, that's really farfetched
You're basically asking her to kill herself for her business
It's not like Tottoland where Big Mom has her whole population willing to give for her
Caramel was that one little old lady
Caramel, strong
....probably
Have we ever had *any* indication otherwise?
That's pretty much been the working assumption since we've never actually seen anyone get their soul back or anything
She might be able to, yeh
Wow, how? She doesn't recreate her homies every day
And they're still alive
she's not getting that soul back lmao
Maybe she could bring them back in, I guess?
But, Big Mom's a bad example for that
'cause she's not cycling her life force out, it's just out and staying
Oh she is strong, the point was that she pretty much did it in the best possible way
Gave them a decent home, put them into actual jobs and not just shady slavery
She was bad, for sure
But she wasn't Disco at Sabaody or anything
Yes liatris, because it 100% lacked nuance
Yeh exactly
Unintentionally, i'm sure
CP0 is an excellent job wtf
Literally the second highest station in the world
Stick to selling them to the marines as bad
Selling them to CP0 sets them for life
Oh yeh, did it for 50 years right?
And she never ruined her image
<@!289876647354826752> What do the CD's having slaves have to do with being in CP0 being a beneficial job?
Wow, leaving them on a warrior island without families would equally get them killed
Yeh, just for her image carl
She wasn't good at heart, she was just relatively safer
^ That's a big thing
Big Mom was going to 0 families
Actually selling her into the government would've been literally nothing but benefit to her in every single way
That was 100% the best thing Caramel could've done for her lmao
The other kids, those were the sad ones
Yeh, somewhere near Elbaf dax
No, not the only possible option wow
Not at all, but I also wasn't saying that
nor was anyone else
This wasn't a situation of desperation, it's just not as bad as it could've been
also brb
Stay civil, you're doing well
Caramel had nothing negative to do with Linlin's development
AT ALL.
Now, let me be clear here
It's not that she didn't mean to be or anything like that
Or she was a bad person
She never got the chance to actually fuck Big Mom up
She was going to, for sure
But none of how Big Mom is, negatively speaking, is related to Caramel
In fact, Big Mom's only positive qualities come from Caramel raising her
Exactly lmao
<@!683663101186277416> You keep putting words into my mouth
I never commented on that at all lmao
Yeh Wow, I know we talked about alternatives, but I only brought up how difficult it would be to run a legitimate orphanage because Caramel just isn't the person to put that effort in
Elbaf was a warrior nation filled with giants, and they all wanted Big Mom dead
She actually *did* do what's best for them by leaving
Specifically because of that circumstance, not a general thing
Liatris
Before I come down on you for doing it again
Go ahead and quote where I said any of it was justified for me
Liatris, you keep very purposefully mistaking my argument here
I've never given any support beyond the fact that Caramel actually gave those kids over to better lives than they probably would've had
Just being random orphans in the New World
What you said there was not my argument at all
<@!153450639924396032> So, that means that her trafficking kids is justified somehow?
Because someone insisted CP0 was a bad and dangerous job when it's probably the second or third highest position in the world?
That's fine, you're under no obligation to üëçüèæ
<@!257978175647252480> LOL
<@!186562609254891520>
CP0 isn't going to get turned into slaves
They're the only direct hand of agency the Celestial Dragons have
The Gorosei would prevent it
Probably not, tbh
He may be able to, but I doubt they're allowed to
^
*Might* use them somehow
Or they'll feature in it
But ultimately I'm hoping One Piece is entirely different
Yeh archer, I've always thought so too
Especially since, even before the flashback, we know the poneglyphs have the info on the ancient weapons
Not Laugh Tale
In fact, Laugh Tale's had nothing to do with them beyond the fact that poneglyphs help you find it too
Maybe Elbaf will end up doing it
<@!508198451872268288> The sea kings go crazy when Poseidon is distressed in general
You'd just have to put her on an island and torture her till she screams, they'd try to tear it down getting to her
The location was known in Alabasta, but I don't think it was hidden there
Here's a new one
What if Pluton isn't a weapon?
Or Uranus, for that matter
What if they're actually supposed to be used for constructive purposes?
Not that it's a lie
But like, their actual purposes weren't supposed to be for wiping out islands
Maybe it was even supposed to make them?
What if Uranus or Pluton helped make the Red Line?
If something has enough power to create stuff, it's got more than enough to destroy them
And if they had some hand in making the Red Line, wiping out an island should be cake
Not Poseidon, I was thinking more Pluton or uranus
Poseidon could be entirely unrelated to them, too
They could just be the 3 most powerful things from the Void Century, as opposed to a specific group of things directly connected
But yeh, if Pluton could actually help create an island in some way
I'm sure that'll happen, Archer
Lmao, it was a good one
Quality meme
Oars was called the Continent Puller
Were all of his people or just him?
I thought it was a unique title
Aaaay asante
Sab, I DAMN SURE DO üòÑ
I haven't ordered the book yet, unfortunately I am too broke, ugh
But soon tho, she's gonna love it
LOL that one still hits, haha
Oh really? I might look into that, lol
^
There's a reason Poseidon is a weapon that can "destroy the world" lmao
You really think anyone can stop an army of them?
no, he really can't tho
Name one person in the series who's killed an army of them
A swarm of things 1/5th the size of an island each getting on you is a death sentence, no matter who you are
ONE sea king can be taken care of, sure
1000?
Hell, 100 is your island destroyed
Mihawk doesn't row, but yes he does
Rofl, our biggest things to remember are don't spoil in the wrong places and don't be too crass
Keep those in mind and 9/10 times you'll probably make the right choices üëçüèæ lmao
No, wait wait
> if these high tier characters can easily own them > what happens when its the whole world vs the sea kings <@!289876647354826752>
We know what happens
Because the series told us
They lose
The world, that is.
Anyone who's ever talked about the ancient weapons ever, lol
Exaggerating there, but yes, the general consensus is that the ancient weapons bring about the destruction of the world
It's the whole point about keeping them from anyone's hands
Literally the whole point is that each weapon can bring about worldwide destruction
And incidentally
The fact that the Calm Belt exists with its reputation at all
Should show you that the world can't handle them <:LUL:321931602655707136>
The Calm Belt was swam through by one of the strongest people in the world, and he only had to fight one sea king that we know of, not every one in the belt
Need help verifying?
Wtf no
Sea kings have never been an easy thing to kill
They've *never* been seen as simple prey
That's why, like you said, they're a Worf
They're acknowledged to be particularly powerful
And it's to show how unique it is for someone to actually be able to handle them
Yes, because they're the byword for power in the sea
<@!420202273885519872>
They don't even need 1000, 100 sea kings could take an island out easy
10 could probably cause massive structural damage to it
Now mind you, it took Momonga
One of the more notable vice admirals
A bit of time to kill a sea king, and he didn't like having to fight it
I used to live in Tennessee
And Franky, pasta
So it took 6 sea kings to pull something half the size of an island
Now, when it comes to logias
Obviously sea kings can't do anything because of the lack of haki
But, barring those, they're still a viable threat to everyone
Minus the dudes they literally just can't touch, lol
Color of the Supreme Sea King <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Oh, actually
A group of sea kings would probably just cause a tidal wave
I forgot, fishmen fighting changes currents in the ocean
Sea kings fighting would probably drown an entire country
Aokiji is uniquely powerful against them, that's like saying Enel's not strong because he can't hurt Luffy with his fruit
Zunesha would get eaten by a swarm of sea kings lmao
^
Zunesha is frail
It's massive, and ancient
this isn't a croc
These are massive serpents that can swarm and bite through ships
Zunesha's body is not particularly durable
Jack blew chunks away with just cannon fire, and cannon fire doesn't actually do much to sea kings
They could just swim away from Zunesha before it fell lol
That's really not a good fight for the elephant
Why? That's a long fall
They'd just have to go the way he's not
Probably not, dax
