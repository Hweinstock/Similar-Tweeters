This server isn’t as much fun when actually discussing op lol
Why did you guys stop ? Cmon entertain me
Damn
Only the weak go to general
Btw who tf goes to also manga and why
I actually like Sakura
Damn snitches
Is that a threat <:TamaHuh:735289165109002260>
I can’t stop I’ve been plagued
For real sorry tho
I was kidding bro chill
Why doesn’t anyone get my dry humor
I’ve ordered 96 and 95 in Japanese
That’s fair
Importing from Japan cost me 20 per
I think volumes in Japan are 440 yen which is 4 bucks or less
No it’s official
I checked the shueisha website
I actually bought the digital for the same price
Btw doom I’m not tryna shit post but  I’ve just been here for 13 hours straight and starting to los my shit
Insomnia bro
Haven’t slept in two days
I have no life lol
What about YouTube
My insomnia is doesn’t go away especially lately
It’s just my anxiety. Sorry for being a downer continue your conversations I’ll just watch
Yamato
Carrot can be used for soup
Peros wants to be captain dude
He outright said it
Reject dial
They’re useless now
Tf follows cbr
Grandline had a video about them
Does anyone follow th op virgin
Op virgin is a ooo good
Nah glr is reasonable
How
Yeah
He criticized the reasoning behind their claims and not the characters
Did you see the follow up video
The point of the vid was current real candidates
He established a base for discussion
The. He made his own video
You can’t stop all pirates
The list is ok depending on the standards you want to use
I understand what you’re saying but he’s not an elitist
She prolly could
Are you the real shanks
Dude can’t even kill himeself lol
Nah it’s just ptsd dude
Have faith in kaido
Cbr had weird logic. CBR : luffy can beat kaido bc he’s the main character
A lot of the people in their list had the same weird logic so that’s what glr Criticized them. then he made his own list with the same handicaps he used when judging cbr. Dude is not an elitist even if you don’t like his list.
Joy boy’s review sare fun but his theories are wired
It’s your opinion vegito and I respect it
Ohara is nice tho
Bargo reviews are good too
Morj is god tier
His voice is nice
And he’s reasonable with his theories
Better than joyboy at least
Joyboy lost his shit
Tekking
Joyboy has decent reviews
Yeah tekking looooves carrot too much
Brago has nice reviews but his sketches are weird lately
Tekking is 28
I watch his streams
He’s looking to move out from his mom’s soon
He’s tooo much dude
Dollar store
Yeah he’s buying a house soon
Good for him
He’s dedicated
Yeah 500k
Rogerbase had a weird video with a nami and robin cosplayers
Too much sexual tension
It was sooo weird dude
Tekking works really hard
Lots of videos every eeek
Yeah but I don’t see him perving so it’s good
Tekking is like sitting with your friend and talking about one piece
Cosy
Well I have no friends so tekking helps
Top 21 boobs in op
Seeing marineford with all the VAs and music is really good
Some of it
How was that dude still alive and fighting
Damn
Fair enough
Kin is the one and only strategist
Luffy is def maturing
Seeing Yamato next to him reminds me of old luffy
Would be funny if kin pulls a black zetsu
Yeah funny cuz I’ll drop op
Croco boy in wano would be cool
I don’t think he did
It’s just his df power
Yeah because he pulls the water out
He could dry up living things too
Remember when dried luffy up
He might be awakened still
!goda
Buggy’s fruit is actually pretty cool
He can fly even
But if someone varies his feet he can fly forever
Like in the panel
Im starting to feel like buggy is the real pk
Did he find captain john’s treasure
Yasoop
His fruit is really good
Bara bara would be great with someone competent
Keyword kinda
I don’t think he dodged it. It seems like kizaru aimed for his collar intentionally
Kizaru obviously has good aim so he couldn’t have missed like that
The falling in the water thing makes sense
<:ShanksEvil:544295530893672463>
Why
The whole student thing doesn’t hold much value apparently
Except for kuzan
I think all were
We need to remember that admirals have a job to do so even garp didn’t stop luffy
Do we know when they got genie df
Fuji has good control for a new user
Wasn’t he a friend of akainu
I have a question. Can haki block boa’s stone attack effects
It’s part of her df tho
So it should block it
Anyway how strong is boa’s haki
Don’t all her attacks turn people to stone
Smoker has sea prism on the tip only
Yeah but how strong is her armament
Do we know
What
Why does she have to
Wait where do we see marigold use it
Wtf
Anyone has the panel
Damn I really don’t remember that
Which one is it guys
Lmao
Is this supposed Robbie ryuou
Power went out
How is that ryuou
It seems like regular armament but he was deflected due to basic logic
I don’t see it tbh
Was there really a call back
I’m dumb
Damn I stand correct haaard dude
Boa is way stronger than I thought
Big oof dude
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
So koby has basically no chance
Just ignore him guys
Or call a mod
It’s bait
I really thought coby could fight boa a little tho
I was sleeping on boa hard all this time
Yeah koby fell for Rebecca
Who do you guys think has a chance against boa
Other than luffy and Fuji
Queen has no chance lmao
Minks aren’t attracted to humans right
Yeah bepo wanted to see a female bear in Amazon Lilly so they are probably not
Panda woman is too beautiful
Are there levels to coc
It’s basically just how strong someone’s will us
There’s probably more to coc
We’ll see more coc probably just like other haki
> <@!564773067969265674> What we know now: > - Bang bang bangs weak af mfs that wouldn't even be worth fighting > - Skilled playas can pick who they choose to spare > - A skilled playa could fuck a cool boat <@!415999229564157955>  yeah but there should be levels just like armament and observation right
Neko mega savage
Next chapter will be goood
Pedro woulda looked cool in sulong
He’s too cool already
I’d rather lose Botha leg and n arm
Pedro is cool but I like him mostly because if his sacrifice
I’m loving the cover story
Oda is a troll
Yeah bc it’s hilarious
Poor pound no one likes him
I’d take the shirts shanks cosplay
Losing an arm looks cooler too
Pedro will of p
Is that hiyori from this episode
Current
Hiyori > boa
Yeah I think
I’m still not sure about the hiyori toki situation
Toei wants to attract horny teens so it makes sense
I’m okay with the aura
H> Horny teens like women with no digestive organs? <@703504844903940096>  honey teens don’t care about digestive organs
Boa’s face in the anime was weird in impel down
I loved op in elementary school. Saw baratie on tv
Two years ago I really got into it
Arlong crushing a canon ball with his mouth was so good especially as a kid
I actually dialed math bc I was catching up with op
Tf is that lady
The only time I failed was in 9th grade history
Op being long is the best part
My brother says op is dumb
Sad noises
People used to 24 ep animes won’t watch op
Three eyes are beautiful how dare you
I’d genuinely like a girl with three eyes like pudding
Been over a year
Who doesn’t find this pretty

Best girl
Fight me
Baratie and arlong park were top tier
I love you vain
Big brain stoopid
Wdym it’s better to learn about characters
That’s your problem not oda’s
Jk
Why wouldn’t you care about other characters
Like who
But it’s not like we get a detailed backstory for every character tho
Those side ones serve the purpose of world building
Stop
How do they make the act too long if they’re side characters
That’s not a reason
Lamp
You guys all worried about college and shit while I just take a gap year
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
A year after highscool where you don’t go to college
I need a break dude
I like learning but fuck school
I was the bully <:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
Just a joke gaben
Bro I lived in three countries so far it’s hard
Nah
I wanna go there tho
Yeah I speak five languages
Technically 7
I’m tryna get a scholarship in Japan now
For next year
That’s the best compliment I ever got
Thx gaben
Where did everyone go
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
I slept last night doom
Wow time zones exist
Sup
Tf is up with wives
I’m a tequila kinda guy
Or wine
Would love a harekon
Oof
It’s the weird part of the server agian
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
What
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
Big brain time
2 each bro
Muslims
You can have 4 then
> <@564773067969265674> if ur wife accept it but who does <@606196171307745308>  no I think the wife can’t object
She can’t even get divorced if he treats her well
Where u from
4 wives
All Muslims in Muslim countries can
Bro take it from me they can
Whits a peaceful discussion
But ok
Idk
Beats me
Prolly not
We need more op odaaaa
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
What’s the point of powerscaling ? seriously
I’ve been lurking
Don’t fall for it vegito
Oh no
Guys chill please
Doom vegito take it easy guys
I need to reread
Can a coc users stop the seakings tho
A lot of people are more powerful than I remember
That’s be worse
And the earth with them
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
You sound like akainu king
You’re the most necessary sacrifice
What a  big brain discussion
Hi tanu
Please save us
Sup
Mine works fine
Don’t be in denial
King
Stop lying king
That’s garou I thought it was rayligh
Shinonu should do it
She hasn’t done shit so far
Why the hell was the impact of kaido falling so big
Yeah but it looked like he was King Kong gunned

Look at this shit
Tf is this
They can’t be that strong
Yeah 10k meters is the same as a few floors
Wdym he’s already cool
Or his beautiful mane
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
We just need kaido’s height width and bf percentage to calculate his weight
Yeah she thinned up
Somehow
Kaido always says he’s sober after getting hurt tho...
What
They said the raid will be in a full moon two years ago bro
> Kaido wasn't hurt after Luffy's "beating" <@!407999944675295265>  semantics
Gifters have no chance
Smile users look dumb and are weak. What’s wrong with kaido
Is he that desperate
Not cool bro
Wasn’t bear guy in the background in the manga
Kyoshiro is denjiro was too obvious
Not cool oda
Still don’t believe komurasaki is hiyori tho
I don’t know what to think tbh just a gut feeling
Kamazo was dope
> <@!564773067969265674> wtf <@690158729685106749>  gut feeling bro
There more to her
The toki stuff is still weird
So I’m not sure
I’m a dumby dumb dumb tho
It all seems to simple rn
Queen music is so good
Imagine paying for gifs lol
What’s with his chin
Jango right
Don’t ruin doffy for me
Doffy’s pants too tight got walking like that oof
Are the og bbp capable ?
Doki doki
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
It’s better not to know
Is that An afrobull pp tanu
Is your photo an afrobull art
Oh shit nvm
Similar art style
Guys we all know that hikari e is the best
> I have lost 90 lb in the last year <@242843145501540363>  damn boy good for you
Is it cheaper
Seen worse tbh
I’ve seen brown hair Yamato and it’s worse
Wtf is happening here
I leave for 5 minutes
Give it up king
What did morj say
Why do people love the egg and scopper so much
> because the egg is just so random , such a theory bait <@690158729685106749>  <:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
And every shadow we see us scopper lol
Is the posirdon cycle by years or generation
So 100 years regardless of the generations passed
How can someone control posiedon tho
It’s a person not a ship
> She raised them in an incredible loving home and was seen as a saint to the public <@!114296407816404992>  but then she crushes all that by selling them which is worse than selling them from the beginning
What are blugori ? Like what type of creature
Those are some weird gorillas
Editor’s statement was dumb tbh
No need to lie for hype
> yaa its hard to feel for scabards <@741980477765845022>  wtf
Didn’t cry but it’s not like I didn’t feel for them
They’ve been through 20 years of torture dude
I didn’t cry a lot in op
Queen disagrees
Luffy vs ussop was epic
Choosing right colors isn’t graphic design it’s common sense
But what did you expect from such channels
Hat toei is the best character in op
Look at his beauty
I loved hattori bashing that rope guy
Carrot has only her looks going for her
I never liked jinbe but I was happy to see him in wano
He will grow on us with time
Carrot has personality yes but not enough to be a straw hat member imo
I never really cared for her tbh
I sometimes forget that she exists but she’s cool tho
I like her connection with Pedro
Respectable
I wouldn’t Mind if carrot joins but I wouldn’t  mind not either
> if carrot joins the crew I will literally eat a bug in voice chat <@!289876647354826752>  I will remind you if she does
Yamato reminds me of old brash luffy I just love her
Or neither
Ulti and Yamato have somewhat similar personalities so far
What’s confusing about Yamato
> she want to become oden and all... <@741980477765845022>  it’s not the translation problem. She lit wants to be oden. That’s her goal and desire. Probably bc of kaido abusing her
Why do people hate peros lmao
> oh... but is she admiring oden or one time she said to luffy that you are more oden than me <@741980477765845022>  she meant that he’s more free than her just like oden was free. She was still wearing the cuffs and thinking about how her freedom is stolen so she won’t be able to become oden
Yeah it’s time for her  to become oden bc she is free and fight is starting against Kai
> oh i see <@!564773067969265674> <@741980477765845022>  I hope that I explained it well enough
You good stoppid
Can robin grow limbs is die of people
> <@!564773067969265674> If she can make a clone of herself, can she just sprout blood everywhere? <@!415999229564157955>  can she grow a mouth inside of kaido and bite his heart ?
Money underrated waifs
Kiku has been amazing especially in fights
> stupid half bird <@!724666824762982443>  and the discrimination continues
Monet is amazing man
She sacrificed her self too so she loyal
Vivi acts so childish sometimes
I still like her tho
But vivi is too naive
Ulti is brash not childish
No one hates carrot but those who like her like her too much so it drives people away
> <@!564773067969265674> Doesn't she have to see it tho (iirc)? If that's the case she'd have to create eyes inside his mouth and esophagus and then the mouth where the heart is. I believe in her <@!415999229564157955>  I don’t think that she can see his heart form his throat but good point
Carrot has best hair imo
Chopper looks 4 lol
Carrot might be the same as vivi situation
I like carrot as a character but I never thought of her as a straw hat
> <@!564773067969265674> She can't, but heart (specifically the left atrium) is directly in front of his esophagus (which goes to your stomach, it doesn't stay in the throat), so she'll see where it beats and just bite that part. She'll get the heart for sure, as it is really close. The esophagus is so close to the heart that the left atrium has an esophageal impression. Of course Oda knows this <@!415999229564157955>  that’s actually interesting but of course oda knows this and more
Is the carrot debate over
No seriously
Nice
I love the enthusiasm here
No plz tell me
I don’t know shit
Idk what do you wanna tell me about
What do you like most about the sunny
Weapons in wano are hella cool
Is it confirmed that that gorosei dude has the other kitetsu
Damn stoopid is goat
Brook no piano op is shit
Straw hat interactions lacking lately we need more oda
Chopper without his hat is weird tho
Sunny still has that make shift pool tho
They just don’t use it
Doffy veins sound in the anime is weird
Why is it delayed
So it’s late in Japan too not just viz
Lmao
It’s a good place to call home
Elaborate plz
Like what
Zoro is badass tho
Franky revers centaur us too op
Brook and robin are awakened change my mind
Is he hot
The suspense damn tanu
He’s really good tho
You mean animak with a c
lol why
It’s dumb but kinda funny
Do you watch the virgin podcast
What do you think
What tension
Are we watching the same podcast lol
But yeah it’s good really reasonable analysis
I love it when he gets annoyed
Animak is the one holding the thing together
Nux and Briggs are too chaotic
He’s just there to fanboy over stuff
He’s the kinda guy I wanna talk to about cool moments
The guests are cool tho
Nux is a shit poster
I went through a phase with his content
Nux has a fan base tho
No one understands zoro smh
I like nux in the podcast only
You should see their op podcast it’s hella dope
189
Nux is so dumb
You’re dumb for saying that
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
Nux is a necessary evil
Akainu is mega Japanese
Akainu’s face looks so Japanese and the Sakura tats too
Akainu sees himself as the lesser evil
Isn’t Hawaii part of America
I think Hawaii and Alaska are both American soil now
Yeah I know
I like how fleeb keeps throwing jokes tryna see what’ll stick
That panel was weird
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
Im scared guys
Luffy wining against lucci after two rokugons was bs
Luffy was almost dead but he just stood up and fucked up lucci which was satisfying but not fair
How did that last Gatling gun finish lucci who was in better shape than luffy
Luffy took two rokugons dude
I genudont see it
Luffy was almost dead tho
Yeah so basically almost dead lol
I like the fight and I like lucci getting his ass beat but I feel weird about it
> I miss chibi Luffy <@!521427565492305931>  truest thing ever said
> <@!564773067969265674> then , how do you feel about luffy vs katakura , 11 hits vs 103 hits and luffy still won ? <@690158729685106749>  you might not like my answer but kata gave him the win kinda. It was a moral win rather than power. Kata was obviously leagues ahead
> you actually understood the fight , but don't use ' katakuri gave him the fight ' <@690158729685106749>  yeah that’s why I said kinda. Idk how to phrase stuff
Kata had stronger armament and future sight and his fruit was lit the upgraded version of luffy’s so he’s better in every way
Yeah but kata can sustain the same level of power but luffy can’t. And in the early armament clashes luffy got hurt
Kata coulda beat luffy earlier if he wanted but he liked luffy so he kept fighting
It’s not about who’s stronger it’s about respect and character
At least that’s how I see it
Exactly
Enel and croco boy were dumbasses
Kata vs luffy us one of if not the best fight
It has more depth
I love luffy vs bluno
Luffy fucked him hip good with gear 2
Man when he held his horns
It’s so satisfying
Telling him he can’t keep up with him anymore <:NamisNotOk:624327350410018838>
Zoro haki situation is very vague
A lot about zoro will be clear after wano
Ryuou might have diff forms or levels
I know that ryuou is just haki I swear. You know what I mean bro
I mean that what swordsmen use might be diff than what luffy uses now but it’s still ryuou
Japanese use forks and spoons for certain foods
Chopsticks are the best dude
Using chopsticks to cook is amazing
Really funny dude
Did you try using them
<:WBDisgust:650047749831524372>
Wano people say ryuou and they mean advanced so it’s probably the only one they know
Kaido last chapter says oden’s ryuou
Doesn’t kaido know what haki is
The ryuou thing is confusing
I will re read in Japanese from when ryuou is mentioned to try to understand
What chapter was ryuou first mentioned
> Well, he did it a bit more shady than that. It wasn't like he just made bad theories, he'd do translations and "facts" but pepper in his own opinion to decide an issue instead of just an unbiased translation <@!114296407816404992>  so his analysis is biased or does he star when it’s his opinion
> <@!564773067969265674> It'd be like he'd translate a vivre card and insert something that was just clear not on the card at all <@!114296407816404992>  oof if that’s true then I don’t know how to feel about him. I look up to his work man
Tontata were basically there to join the fleet otherwise dresssrosa woulda been the same
Chopper has good backstory tho
After 20 years of story and waiting a lot of people will be mad at the ending
Op is about the journey for me tho
I’ll take any ending tbh
Man imagine a Friday with no op but there’s nothing next Friday
I can see op going for 7 more years
Yamato is huge
Sup guys
How long has chat been dead
Hey
Go to role info bro
Is there really nothing about op to talk about
Oda’s handwriting gives me pain
Wtf is uroge saying
Yeah but I’m rusty
Actually reading kanji is easier than words
Yeah I did the last 2
It’s easier bc you know the word without having to read letters
Much Faster too
Thx naism
I talked to juba
He sent me some better fonts
So it’ll look cleaner next time
I talk when I feel safe
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
No I only did one
No unfortunately
French team has their own leaker for high quality scans
So raws we get won’t work
Thx tanu but I really don’t feel like I’m doing much
Joy boy does a good job mentioning the differences
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
He is cringy at times
But I like watching him fanboy over op in his room
Feels cosy
Does he really
I never heard him saying that
But I wouldn’t be surprised
I like the bleach aesthetic but I don’t think the story is as good as op
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
Cmon do it coward
Boooo
I except better from u tanu
Never thought about that
Zoro is oden confirmed
Yamato is oden zoro is oden I am oden
If Yamato becomes shogun the all the work was wasted
Not even hiyori Can become shogun
Jinbe was mentioned in baratie
How do you guys know all This
I need to get educated
Panda man is forever
Yamato still fresh tho give her time
I’m still now warmed up to jinbe yet tbh but I like him
Oda won’t kill a sh
I would like to see it tho
I don’t care who dies as long as it makes sense
Not all scabbards tho
I just don’t want kiku to die
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
I want to see koby in wano he needs to develop
Clothes
Remember zoro sitting on a grave foreshadowing
Why does everyone want ussop to die or get captured
Robin captured Is more interesting
She can do stuff
That’s actually true
I really feel for robin
Psychological torture
She held o the bridge with her teeth ffs
That scene broke me
I don’t like where this is going
Sad or badass
I really don’t like I wanna live but I like it’s build up
Didn’t impact me
No one deserves to die was better for me
I think she danced in wano
Robin stealing franky’a speedo was badass
Yes
Not cool
Tanu ftw
Nina haki too strong
I hate franky for getting all that love
Brook x chopper is weirder
Now you have you’re welcome
> r/chopperpiece <@!439770223944400896>  don’t remind me plz <:Crydo:586275183032270849>
Pudding is crazy and you know what they say about crazy
Kaido dodged a bullet by leaving rocks
Exactly
Especially with how genetics work in op
If bm eats bb will she have 3 df
Age is just a number prison is just a place
I mean if you were 17 would you marry a 40yo ?
Take it easy vergoat
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
Boa will hate that
Mine are 11 but it’s just weird still
How tf did we get here
Magellan was so cool
Do you think king is the same species as Magellan
General looks
Wings and black rubber suit
King is kinky
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
King seems competent
I mean kaido seems to rely on him
Tf is that abomination
So before kaido came to wano damn
Moria has potential
I don’t think taking kaido’s shadow is that easy
He thinks he’s smart with his plan but he’s just lazy
Damn oda’s art is amazing
Moria was in the middle of nowhere why would he use haki
It’s a discussion out of love for op
Part of the enjoyment
Marco might have a chance
Bepo sulong underrated
Yeah but people just dismiss him
Can Marco take damage without haki
I was surprised to see kiku stabbing kaido’s hand
Can she take his soul if he’s not afraid of he r
The yonkou have weird personalities
I’m over shanks at this point tbh
We don’t know anything about shanks so everyone is just throwing shit at the wall tryna see what’ll stick
CBR are just trolls
Fmi 5th
That has some merit actually
Shanks is pure hype
Why doesn’t the wg kill doffy already
Oh shit I forgot but why is Magellan protecting him
Sitting at the toilet
Oden might’ve told kaido smth that scared him
Kaido killed the hag to feel better but he still cheated
Kaido us a pirate after all so it might be fair game to him
Yeah he seems to think about that moment a lot
Momo is maning up lately
I like him
Luffy’s influence on momo is great
Man he’s just a fucking child
Let me see you standing up to big ass dude when you’re 9
> i wouldn't stand up to him i would have told him to kill me <@651757948061745162>  yeah I believe you
Tf is bluejam
Tf is that
Nah Yamato is female luffy
Yeah Yamato is just like the old luffy brash and wants to be free
I don’t think she’s the queen tho
Maybe her daughter
I mean if the queen was missing all this time from the kingdom someone shoulda noticed right
Ulti using a mace is so cool
Seen it 100 times
That’s a actually funny
Why is she giving chopper a cucumber
Yeah how did people fall for it
Next chapter will be fire

Punk hazard I think
No
There hours to go
Doesn’t Crunchyroll have a manga section too
<:Crydo:586275183032270849>
You’re such a bully tilted
Sanji crying by the window broke my heart
Old why people hat wci
Fair
Doesn’t mha have better animation and pacing tho
I never got into it tbh and their fan base doesn’t help
> Oda reveals the "idc take this world building info" info in sbs <@310219637357019137>  oda might still care but he has no time to dive into it
True
Why did people hate oden dancung
It has a purpose obviously, we still don’t know oden’s intentions fully
Oden seems to believe hard on the prophecy of raftel or something
Does the grade of the sword affect its power or is it just notoriety
It’s just up to the user imo as long as the blade itself is good
Have we seen blades break bc the user us too strong
> Zoro straight up breaks any weak sword and that's before he even got that strong <@521783526878609418>  yeah but I mean good swords no the trash swords he used to break
Wadi will def stay with zoro
I think zoro will turn wado black no way he’s gonna break it or lose it
Is samurai gandhi confirmed to have shodai
A black blade isn’t stronger it’s just from the long term haki use right ? So why are you mad about wb blade not being black
So does the haki remain stored in the blade or is it just the color
But how does the blade become more tough if haki isn’t stored in it
I’m not sure but there was talk about how they’re tougher
Aren’t they stated not to break
Then that must be some headcanon I heard somewhere
No I understand what Mihaawk meant
It’s called night
Lol
Barely saved it
I like the haki aura thing actually
Hyo stated that luffy needs to use the extra haki escaping his body to use ryuou
The anime is pushing the aura too hard
They need to tone it down
Quantified power levels ruin a series look at dbz and sds
Seven deadly sins
Same with sds
They realized it was dumb
The aura can be good if done well
Yeah it’s bad rn
Maybe a small transparent aura would be good
Just to show haki flow like nen but more toned down
What’s is canon lmao
They can tone it down even more than oda and make it colorless
The anime is great rn
I don’t think the aura will be used hard every time someone uses adv haki in the future
Chill Alex it’s just a discussion
Yeah but we can still talk about it
Doom with the facts
Wano colors for some people real mad
Coc in movies is cool but too much imo
Coc can’t just be to knock out fodder tho
How
There’s def more to coc
It’s been hyped since day 1
Yeah shonks damaged wb ship with his coc but I don’t think luffy can do that yet
Roger clashing with wb without touching. Us that coc or adv armament
Lmao
Hiyori is nowhere to be seen rn
I don’t trust hiyori bro
Tanu rn
> Anyone know what time knew chapter is out? I was reading that it’s at 11 am est <@739821850527399996>  less than 90 min till it’s out
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
What is happening here
Lol
Asian people start aging at 70
Short hair nami is very nami
