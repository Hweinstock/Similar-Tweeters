I am beyond names
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
THATS NOT TRUE
no, I changed mine coz Bubs changed hers, so I was like ... "trying to be Red's favorite hmm" so I changed it for like 2 seconds. I wasn't gonna keep it obvs. Tendo isn't even close to my favorite character from Haikyuu
üò°
yes
actually
Tsukki
I was contemplating reading Haikyuu before
casual
really?
OH FUCK
I spilt water all over my desk
just wiped it with my shirt
too lazy to get a paper towel
I'm both
literally
I'm half british
yeh, it's a shame
is it any good?
yeh enjoy
favorite arc

I'll put it on my list
probably be 5 years by the time I get to it
nani??
||This is really awkward, So I'm just gonna wait for it to pass <:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045> || DONT OPEN ALEX <@!287712421165137920>
I only know Chika from this fucking dance
and my mom thinks I'm a weeb coz she caught me watching it
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
I know that, but I didn't want my parents to think any less of me
now they do
I dunno who that is
oh, I thought he was a former user or something
yep
I have the big gay
ur outta nitro
ur not a booster anymore

we are the elite
idk
I think it was Doom
that's cringe
what a loser
let me check
2 are mine
120
fuck I'm slow
I need to hurry up
fine
I'll just go give them to BDA
smile is gonna finish Berserk tonight
<:BepoSad:626931310241251360>
nitro boosters have big pp's
no Marc
I just don't have the cognitive capacity to read fast
yes
its honestly a life saver
yeh so I just finished ||Lost children|| Berserk 120
hello there
I don't know how you could read any manga
on ur phone
oh
that's what I do
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
I just have mine like this, then change every volume
am I doing it wrong?
wait red, do you prefer Berserk to One Piece?
who doesn't
are you finished?
so like 15 chapters left
361
smile might have the world record
Is Berserk on there tho
I haven't read enough manga for my list to have and validity
the only things I could confidently have in my top 5 are OP, Haikyuu, Vinland, and thats about it
really?
I have s3 as a 10
the rest are like a 9 I think
do I follow Stranger?
I've watched the first 2 episodes of FMAB probably 5 times. Never got past that point
lmao
s4 is definitely not a 10 for me
<:rebki:374759708223078400>
I've only seen s1 of mob psycho
FUCK
I clicked that <a:GutsMegaCry:721314623495733288>
literally didn't mean to not ur fault
FUCKKLKLD
funny you say that red. Coz I literally have a list called things to read after berserk lmao
yeh definitely
I like the idea of act age a lot
who cares
we have the first seed
but yeh
I'm worried for the playoffs
is that 259 or 359?
not available in my country <:MoriaFeels:544294371512811521>
you also did the joke wrong <@!742188277527871579>
it's meant to be Mike Oxlong I'm pretty sure
if you link ur accounts
woah chill dude
<#164971940648321024> <:SengokuPalm:701663557338529802>
kade sent me a friend request lol
I have no idea
dub voices all the sound the same istg
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
I knew it
oh I was joking, is that actually what happens??
just recycled VAs
?
Wow
you're actually caught up
that's impressive
what she can read in an hour, is what i can read in a week <:LULW:607641487429206106>
I'm really slow
I thought you were only on MF?
that can't be true
ur on here too much to have been reading 6-12 hours straight
for Berserk at least
yes, I'm the biggay
HOW DO YOU DO THIS? It's actually impressive
cuts people in half
it's an easy 10
only need 2 days
Miura should make the chapters 40 pages now since they're so infrequent
<:Uso:637751966184767546>
yeh I guess that's true
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
if they were 40 pages we'd only get 1 chapter last year <:CrocoKidEvenMoreDistorted:586469633419378704>
god I'm stupid
how does it feel to be caught up smile
he must be in his 50s now right?
wooh
I need to pick up the pace
I'm going TOO slowly
um... 120 I think
||Binding chains chapter|| Berserk 120
||I think he might be in my top 3 villains of all time now|| Berserk 120+
I haven't
I'm doing good so far
I don't
||do you prefer binding chains to lost children?|| Berserk 120 Archer
read them first
they're the actual first chapters
no
I did that lol
messed up big time
I really enjoyed black swordsman actually
376
ig
but they're longer
tag that
||well it's a female||
wait Shim
you haven't read the letter chapters?
I think Black Swordsman being before Golden Age was a good decision.|| Guts is sooo much darker during Black Swordsman than the beginning of GA. Seeing the transformation was amazing|| Berserk
oh Archer I have another question
||so, you know how Rosine turned the abducted children into little insect "elves", is that similar to how the Count turned Zondark into that monster thing. And does that mean all all apostles can do that? And... are those "minion" technically apostles themselves? surely not coz they didn't have their own beherit and sacrifice to the godhand?|| Berserk Archer
ohhh ok
that makes sense
I see
thanks guys
because Golden Age works well as its own story
||its a prequel/flashback from the first arc|| Berserk
the biggest WTF moment so far would probably be ...
um
||Either king of midland with Charlotte, or Donovan I guess. But that's more of a "damn, this is pretty dark and intense moment". The biggest "holy shit, this is amazing moment" is definitely the entire eclipse. Some of the best fiction I've ever read.|| Berserk
||God just thinking about the eclipse sequence. How do you come up with something like that. It's just so damn good|| Berserk 94
ok, I think this is a good time to go read some more myself
see ya
<:ok_Griff:452942412579471411>
I'll come back on if I finish|| binding chain||
yes sir
blazers are a real threat to the lakers if we have to play them first round
I think they'll make it Juba
ngl
||LMAO, is there a female character in Berserk who we don't see the tits of? <:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045> || Berserk 125
||k I finished binding chain|| Berserk 127 <@!373144491005313025>
||definitely prefer lost children, but still pretty good|| ^
?
are you joking or serious?
oooh
ok
hope you enjoy
<a:Tokorun:572105804526780469>
you missed this one

<:LULW:607641487429206106>

||Archer would you sacrifice me to become a member of the godhand?|| Berserk 127
<:LuffyThink:701983952482599032>
hmmmmm
<:PuckSmug:497263468416598022>
lmao
why the FUCK isn't there an Arlong emote yet
too many crocokids
arlong
please
<:CrocoSlash:671943887136358431>
I have never seen anyone use this
we don't need
ARLONG
I love how people reacted with the same emote???
Doesn't make sense
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
watch the '97 version
I did
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
I watched the 97 version just to hear AH AHAHAHAHA
that's meant to be guts' theme
I only got to 8 and a half hours last night
there we go
music
I actually listened to the theme of guts for almost 9 hours straight
I'm impressed by that ngl

ty ty
why are you so weak Youssef üò¶
I mean yeh basically
this meme sums it up best
I look some of the openings she's done sure
don't know much of her other music
I like ADAMAS as well
I think that was for SAO
idk I never watch it
oh wow the hiyori emote has already been made
that was fast
wait is that from another server?
yep it is
ok
its called :hiyorihappy: but it's not from this serber
poor Moria
now he's just a chonky boi
It‚Äôs Red
Tch
What‚Äôs with this shit quality
Lucky roux is from south
I think Beckman is from north
Yeh
Kidd and Killer are from South orc
Iirc
Shim
Do you still think Ulti and/or P1 is joining Kid?
Is it worth buying the physical copies for Jojos?
I like one piece
Part 5 is probably the one I‚Äôm most looking forward to
And yeh I‚Äôm like halfway through pt 2
4 looks good
3 looks like horseshit
7 also looks good
Lol these are all based on reading short spoiler free synopsis‚Äô so i don‚Äôt really know
Haikyuu
Just more and more Haikyuu
||I know pt 4 has Kira, and he looks like a good villain so|| pt 4
I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about so I won‚Äôt go further lol
Ugh Jojos just seems like such an arduous task smh
But I also want to read it
<:ok_Griff:452942412579471411>
You can just tell Mai‚Äôs bout to whip out an essay
Definitely a movie or are you willing to watch TV shows as well?
You should just hate me as much as possible now
So I can‚Äôt disappoint you anymore
üçë
Who‚Äôs corny tilted?
Zeph is a lovable weirdo
Ulti 4 nakama
<:rebki:374759708223078400>
So random
I know I don‚Äôt want Ulti lol. But the fact that people all said that when she appeared in 1 PANEL just shows this banbase‚Äôs capacity for stupidity
Yamato‚Äôs looking more and more likely now
But at the end of the day
I don‚Äôt really care
We have Jinbei
Apoo is the worst thing to ever exist
Actually makes me sick
That fucking Apoo vs Zoro and Luffy week damaged me
Powerscalers existence is a sin
Nah they can‚Äôt
Have you seen some of the most wild takes
<:WBDisgust:650047749831524372>
What‚Äôs rule no 1 of powerscaling
What‚Äôs worse?
Powerscalers or speedreaders/arc skippers
I‚Äôm a straight A student when it comes to One Piece knowledge
Test me
Pop quiz
I‚Äôm never wrong
<:AkainuLUL:726025066361651281>
I‚Äôm going to Harvard with powerscaling as my major
This class is a joke
And this teacher is a scam
Rigatoni üëå
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
Hmmmm
Rigatoni isn‚Äôt real
He can‚Äôt hurt you
It‚Äôs an old wise tale
Rigatoni is a figment of your imagination
What‚Äôs he gonna do?
<:BrookShrug:680559335058702376>
I can take it
I have the mental fortitude of a polar bear
Ok I‚Äôm prepared
Ok nvm
We‚Äôre back to one piece
Yep
They have much better control over it tho right?
That was stated right Choc? That they have to train their sulong?
Sulong is such a cool idea
Yes
All the minks will that‚Äôs why Neko said it lol
Coz Neko is better
I‚Äôm expecting big big things from Neko and Inu sulong
Realistically
Wtf is Raizo gonna do
That‚Äôs canon for me
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
Yes
If you read the first page of chapter 222
You know Usopp and Chopper are fighting the numbers
I think Sanji has called him Zoro 6 times iirc
And Zoro has called him Sanji even less
Now I don‚Äôt know if a scabbard will die actually
Kinda on the fence about it
Kanjuro I‚Äôm not counting
Ashura I can see
But I don‚Äôt think Kin of Denjiro will die
I don‚Äôt think he will
Arlongs the best villain in the series so you should reread Arlong park
<:BrookShrug:680559335058702376>

||Wait so does each Jojo part have multiple villains? As in main antagonists not just side villains?|| Jojos in general

It is
!
||Black Swordsman Arc Guts is very very edgy lol. But that's why we love him|| Berserk ch 4
BB only handed in Ace to gain the warlord position so he could break into impel down and gain crewmates
speedreaders
yep

yeh ur going pretty slow
you were on Zou for like 2 weeks
thats not a bad thing
fine
||that's why I love him|| Berserk ch 4
tch
Why don't people get this
<a:REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEGIF:393866924192432158>
read!!!
retention is gained through discussion?
so talking on discord is the best way to learn the story??
I really really really don't think it is
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
discussing it correctly
correct and accurate discussion builds retention
if people are spouting nonsense coz they can't be bothered to read the actual manga
it just wastes everyone's time.
gn
wait back up, what was ur first point, I missed it <@!268137256051539971>
that wasn't planned tho
no he didn't
<:SengokuPalm:701663557338529802>
where does it say that?
remember
BB is an opportunist
No its not
he handed in ace to get access to impel down
no just that
how tf are you gonna predict the biggest war in histroy
where does it say that?
show me the panel
BB didn't even know Ace was Roger's son
how did he know he would cause the biggest war ever
<:DoffEZ:586408476025028608>
to get to impel down
it's actually never been explicitly revealed how the marines figured it out
we can infer that they just did based on gathererd intel
it wasn't Garp lol
they just found out
it's never been explained in detail
why would they kill the hero of the marines
he can get away with literally punching a noble
Guys
I will literally find you the panel
give me a sec
he's being executed because they believe he could one day be PK like his daddy
here you go
lol Choc
read it
they believed he could one day be PK and cause more problems
2 of us have posted the panel that debunks your statement
like, its all explained in one chapter
Watch Haikyuu
you do
wait just animes or are you willing to read manga?
That is literally never stated
??????
are we reading the same story?
Blackbeard?
ok
I see
ohhh
nvm
I already saw this
I'm big dumb dumb
<:shutupretardstoptyping:736095674730414081>
gotta read berserk
is made in abyss ongoing?
the manga?
read Haikyuu
you won't regret it
I used to collect beyblades lol
I need to decide on what manga I'm gonna read after Berserk
coz for anime, I'm just gonna catch up to Gintama
oh I'm caught up to Vinalnd
have you watched s1?
it is
but I thought s1 was still good
gdi
didn't you say you did that with another series
or was that someone else
<:SengokuPalm:701663557338529802>
oh ur just Bokuto now
I should make a gif pfp
yes
I have never had an original idea in my life
so I have to steal
yeh irl people are overated
me neither
ngl, ur new pfp, when I first saw it, I thought it was Morgan Freeman for a split second
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
I'm sorry Mai
did you say
THANOS????
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
idk see it
I see morgan freeman
for the first slide
does no one else see Morgan Freeman???
but you see Thanos?
another try ... Doen you read 1 chapter
that doesn't count as a try
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
there's no snap emote?
<a:LuffySnap:701662015319441458>
oh look at that
<a:7874_RicardHOO:735441703045038201>
I like one piece ngl
the ultimate eye test
read the first line
wait is Chihayafaru a sports manga?
what sport
where's this list from
ah ok
is that the one with the dog on the cover?
I'm skimming through chapter 1 of Chihayafaru to see if I like the art
and I gotta say
its really good
I definitely will give it a read eventually
Big Mom asking if Kaido was dead with a smile on her face was actually funny af
we did it bois
we did it
<:CryBoy:585546888175157258>
I should be banned from this channel til I read more stuff
lol
ok, so I've been reading one piece for pretty much 10 years now
but for some reason it never occurred to me that there maybe more in this medium than just one piece
kinda crazy
I know
I was shocked when I found out
so gradually trying to build up my portfolio of manga
I treasured it while I had it
life goes on
!anilist
make an anilist
I much prefer the anilist UI but ur right, it's a matter of preference
yeh, for you elites, the xp gap is pretty big
k I'm gonna go read some more Berserk have a good one guys
Choc, I was curious about the user Zolo coz of all the memes so I went back and looked at some logs. Dude, you and him seemed to go at it <:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
yeh, I can't tell if he was trolling or not?
give me a life size sunny first
yeh
and I want it
!pics
click that
I'm down
lol
click on the blue link
its 4:20 what am I doing awake
<:CrocoKidZoom:661610502543114290>
kewl
ur good
<a:GutsMegaCry:721314623495733288>
only current chapter
so when early spoilers come out for new chapters, you gotta go to <#164996746429202432>
that would suck
heard he's biggay
"afraid"
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
are you caught up to the manga?
YAY
top 5 arc
you will love it
coz it's amazing
indeed
it's the best
maybe
are you reading or watching?
you should catch up before coming on here
Manga
imo
if you want MY opinion
the manga is better than the anime 10 fold
but you do whatever you want
you can read it in color now as well
if you want to do that
kuzan
kizaru is unclear justice
I haven't even seen every anime episode
!mangawhere
its linked there
colored manga is up to mid WCI
chapter 869
no
more lol
if its 6 years
how would we get to 1500??
not really
Oda can easily finish it in 5 years
I honestly don't see it going past 1200 chapters
probably not
ok if we get 38 chapters a year on average. that's excluding corona
we're at 987 now, so to get to 1200 with 38 a year, it already would take 5.6 years
it used to be around 3 a month
but corona has kinda cut that down to 3
2
well start getting ready lol
it's really not as far as you think
Goddam I‚Äôve been asleep all day again
<:LUL:321931602655707136>

I fell back asleep for like 10 minutes <:LUL:321931602655707136> <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Hope ur doing ok Sky
And Bean
As someone who‚Äôs been doing it  for 3 years straight now. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs definitely worth it
Hey Viri
<a:aWAHWaving:561303114871734302>
Ok here‚Äôs my opinion from experience
It‚Äôs actually been a lot better when you find a good therapist that DOES understand and figure you out
But that‚Äôs just me
And yeh I don‚Äôt wanna lower the mood lol
<:KataCozy:669368284864446514>

If my brother were on here he‚Äôd get banned instantly
You don‚Äôt wanna meet him

<a:aPES_AngeryArrive:666320713921331230>
NO
Coz there are no spoilers
So there‚Äôs no point in being in there
Damn
I guess I‚Äôm not strong enough <:Crydo:586275183032270849>
Yes make an Evan meme
We should have a contest
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
No not a server wide one
Just like 5 people lol
Yeh Syd, you don‚Äôt wanna meet this Evan guy
He‚Äôs a piece of shit
fats does come online a lot, he‚Äôs just on vacation for the last 2 weeks so he hasn‚Äôt
Paper cuts are the worst things ever
Idk, it was kinda a joke only meant for people here but yeh, if people want to make memes about me, go ahead. I could use a good laugh
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
I think that‚Äôs leaning on the political side of things
Idk
Ask Moe
Yeh ok let‚Äôs change topics
They are the same
<a:runningemote:735442727239417917>
Drink water
Hello new here, I‚Äôm dad
Yes this is my dad Moe
And congrats
Booker is scary
What‚Äôs the topic?
Are you starting the manga?
<:LUL:321931602655707136>

Emood has higher standards than that Doom
Tch
!faguto
That‚Äôs how gay that take was Fagu
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
Doom is good with making memes
I guess this makes me your enemy Emood
I‚Äôm surprised Zeph hasn‚Äôt been banned
He‚Äôd get yeeted back to Sabaody
<a:aPES_Laugh:664885767574781964>
Follicle
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
If Luffy can do it, doesn‚Äôt it just mean that the fruit was capable of that in the first place? The next user would just have to figure it out
I like the setup
...
You gotta win both
E
For
Evan
Luffy on the mug
?
Did you just edit that Doom?
Did you finish that moe meme Grizz?
Who? <:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
Wait 30 years then pick one piece back up
You‚Äôll probably have forgotten by then
EVAN
Oh lmao
How are you so good at edits?
No you didn‚Äôt

Huge quality spike
It‚Äôs pretty garbagio
Ew

I might still give it a shot
Sorry Youss
<a:aPES_PeepoSadRain:718071523864477726>
Lol
Wtf
How
Is there a darts manga???
Surely not
There‚Äôs enough shitty shonen for everyone I don‚Äôt really care anymore
Have whole chapters of a character internal thoughts just to try and dodge a single ball

Let‚Äôs see how wrong this video is
YEET
ok
no ones reading that
Zoro needs to bake a cake
<:CrocoDurr:663850964763279381>
wait people were playing jackbox eariler?
Zoro's arc was romance dawn
we know just as much as you do
lol
now I wanna play something
but first I gotta figure out how to put up my shower curtain
that would be funny af ngl
Edward is his first name
just a reminder
I meant last
I accidently put first
<:rebki:374759708223078400>
now I have embarrassed myself beyond repair
what the fuck does that mean
?
Just tryna import BC into one piece now are we
<:LuffyThink:701983952482599032>
wait did the guy who posted that essay earlier just dip
lmao
idk
but he hasn't said anything since
why are you hyper?
too many lolipops?
<:MoriaFeels:544294371512811521>
from hot to not
You wanna know how Dressrosa had bad pacing in the anime
Coz it‚Äôs 102 chapters in the manga and 118 FUCKING EPISODES IN THE ANIME
how does that happen
They dragged everything
The mets are a joke
The knicks are a joke
New York is a joke
<a:aPES_Laugh:664885767574781964>
wait I was scrolling up, ||someone put the war arc as their favorite arc in naruto??|| Naruto Shippuden
very ... interesting
to me it's literally the worst arc in the series
15 pre ts 17 post ts
Tekking has good one piece knowledge
but his speculation is awful
and he's kind cringe
that's kinda weird
does he realize that when he asks the brick a question .... he's not gonna reply because .... he's a brick
yeh, but Chewbacca could at least go BRGHGGH, the brick can't do anything
its a brick
that's fine, I'm not gonna criticize another person's opinion
but to me, ||the arc was full of inconsistencies, asspulls, drawn out scenes, fan service, the fights weren't interesting at all (at least the ones at the end), it just became Naruto and Sasuke vs Madara, KAGUYA, and that's just a short reason why|| Naruto Shippuden
||And it was unnecessarily long, with just pretty superficial substance. || Naruto Shippuden
||All in all, probably the worst war arc I've seen, maybe besides bleach|| ^
yo fate
oh for sure
||legendary fight|| og nartuo
!seagull
!earl

!yousseffinallygetshiscommandbutnoonewillrememberitbecauseofitslongassnamelol
oh my god
you like the 4kids rap huh?
name every rap song?
I've never heard this before
was this the theme song?
ok, lets put it this way. If they are a competent new world combatant, they most likely have haki
I really doubt Jack doesn't have haki
he did
Ace was confirmed to have all 3 haki
ur right nvm
in the Ace novel which isn't canon, he uses armament, but it is not confirmed
my bad
at the time maybe lol
lol, people really expecting Oda to have planned EVERY single detail of the story since the beginning
Ace was never originally planned to be the son of Roger
but look where we are
but that's the nice thing about these long stories
not everything has to be planned
yep
I agree
I think that's what we were meant to believe
well we were
but I think that's what Oda believed as well
lol
is he on MF yet?
I haven't been keeping up
so how does he still believe Ace is Luffy's biological son?
ok Gaben sending me misinformation
<:Uso:637751966184767546>
he will
I watched the Thriller Bark one again
he won't like Dressrosa
at least as much as the others
He'll HATE sugar
imo
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
damn you Gaben
And I'm even more retarded for reading that retard's work
One Piece is stupid actually
I'm gonna go read more Berserk
That's a great manga Archer
has loads of Mechs and explosions
and comedy
It's one of Oda's best works
Purple Noon is a quintessential piece of Japanese literature
He reminds me of myself back in my youth
wait current arc of what?
I like Berserk
it's cool
really cool
I think I might start Berserk soon
really cool
and there's like 5 of them
lol
guys
I know this might sound crazy
but we actually have an entire channel where you can talk about Jojos
This is a ~~Berserk~~ One Piece channel
Speaking of Berserk
I'll say something in other series
Only compare the two if you've read them both lol
I disagree
you can easily rank arcs in one piece in terms of enjoyment
Berserk is better than Kingdom
take my word for it
I haven't read Kingdom
Berserk is slowly surpassing Vinland for me
and I'm only half way through
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
still birth ceremony
yessir
||I am loving Mozgus as a villain so far. Can't tell if he's an apostle or not. But yeh I'll give you my thoughts when I'm finished|| Berserk 140
around 140
can't remember
||I loved Isidro's introduction as well. I'll have to see more of him, but he seems cool|| Berserk
I read that as "I'm eating Lockers right now"
lol
||He seems like he'd make a good "Robin" to Guts' "Batman"|| Berserk
but I'll wait and see
Guts
probably
I do love ||Thorfinn ||tho
I'm saving up to get the other box sets
HAHA for a second I read that as "I'll get YOU box set 3"
what is wrong with me today
I'm going insane
I watched the 97 anime and the first 3 episodes of 2016
<a:runningemote:735442727239417917>
I needed to hear ||GRIFFFFFITHHHH||
you ever one of those days where it doesn't feel like a proper day
like it just kinda came and went
yep
I listened to guts' theme for 9 hours straight the other day
yeh I get that too
weird stuff
they haven't adapted the whole story at all
2016 Berserk is in my top 5 anime of all time
<:LuffyTruthful:671944878569160714>
yeh aren't they considered the old trio by the fanbase?
they should make a live action Berserk with the budget of GoT
<:CrocoDurr:663850964763279381>
even if there were a good anime
I know I would still the manga by far
Berserk fits black and white
digitally colored Berserk would make me vomit
||<a:GutsPunching:687736942644953151> ||
I have to spoiler tag an emote
lmao
<:CascaBlush:619644402293276694>
||I love Casca. One of my favorite female characters|| Berserk
||I mean nothing beats Slan in terms of female characters <a:dealwithit:448331229851287562> || Berserk
nah, Berserk in colored would be awful
And wdym, the 97 anime was <:ok_Griff:452942412579471411>
I was joking
dude agreed with me
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
the only reason one should consider watching 97 anime, is for guts' theme
boruto <a:PepePuke:654218964162838538>
wait do you mean the boruto manga is looking good artwise? Or that the actual story is good?
coz I can't believe either to be true
||I can't believed it skipped the Wyald stuff <:Uso:637751966184767546> || Berserk 97 anime
yeh
retarded
||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=967S-XSkTZ8|| Berserk 97
I posted this yesterday
but I find it funny af
especially the last one

||Adon is the Buggy of Berserk|| Berserk

yeh thats true
that whole ending was rushed

that's better
haven't seen it, but it's one of my friend's favorite movies
maybe one day I'll go back to the best haikyuu character
read it then
the anime is horrendous
I mean ... yes
but I wouldn't
that's a mans man Archer
you can't separate a man from his boat
THE MAX, I would recommend is 50 chapters. But honestly, everytime I reread, I do about 10 lol
to what
any suggestions
alright if you say so
how about this
OK I'LL CHANGE IT AGAIN
does anybody have any good Tsukki pfps?
if you do just ping me

My friend, berries are equivalent to yen
I know to the other guy
So if Luffy is worth 1.5 billion berries, it‚Äôs more like 15 million dollars
Basically
Higuma would only be worth $80,000 five or take
Oda is known for his exceptional attention to detail
But imma be real
I don‚Äôt think he cares whatsoever about cabbage prices in a fictional universe
Juba, when do you sleep?

...
Nah Canada sucks. USA number 1
üá∫üá∏
Canada isn‚Äôt real
Just walk over there
Do you live in Alaska as well?
Awww that makes sense
You know the weirdest thing
That‚Äôs not real

<a:aWAHWaving:561303114871734302>
I just need Orochi to stay dead
And for Kaido to die
Those are my biggest bets atm I think
<:Crydo:586275183032270849>
Personal net
Bet
With Earl
is he a meme? or just a device used for speedreaders to complain?
I don't remember any of the fillers. Maybe a little of G8
<:MoriaFeels:544294371512811521>
I don't really watch the anime tho
I don't really read the manga either
I don't do either
Haikyuu number 1
<a:aPES_Laugh:664885767574781964>
beautiful haiku emood
it paid off
I started reading One Piece almost a decade ago
and I just turned 13
so..
black clover
yeh we suck
I gotta catchup fast
it's pretty much in the same place
I am actually really hyped for Inu and Neko sulong
next chapter is gonna be good
they saw each other on Zou
as well
I'm gonna delete that
I thought you said Zoro and NAMI
FUCK
REEEEEE
it's too early I can't read
<a:2657_scanlon:734110028931399821>
<a:2840_ReeGun:735441831290208306> <:CarrotWah:641689779930660865>
I have to eliminate the furry
carrot is gonna suicide bomb herself as well to defeat Peros
but he will only lose another arm
just need 4 minks to turn Peros into a nugget
i do
that would be funny
I'm gonna destroy from the inside
is it just you?
where tf is Jack
good joke, bepo being useful
I'm filled with bad opinions, that's why I'm so smart
Bepo is probably the one mink who can't go sulong coz he's a special boi
<:rebki:374759708223078400>
realistically, how do you think this little "scuffle" with Kaido will end for the scabbards?
probably
damn really
you think 3 are dying right now
yeh as once this fight with Kaido is done
shu aren't you anime only
no one say anything
carrot the traitor yeh
> That monkey at the start of zou was also a suspect <@!698761447835959337> THIS
I legit saw this
WHAT THE HELL
people actually thought that monkey mink was the traitor
I mean
my god
tbh, Carrot would have failed at being the traitor like she does at everything else, so I knew it couldn't be her
yeh
I guessed Kanjuro from the beginning
I guess I just have big brain
I legit did
I DID
no joke
I don't believe you
that's ridiculous
what is wrong with you people
believing fate over me
I bet Orochi is dead, I'm sticking by that
permanent name change
I meant, I already bet about Orochi
The bigger meme, is the reader
I really wanna know how Oven fucked up that badly
it has to be
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
character presumed to be dead shows up alive .... DRAGON
it's the only explanation <:CrocoDurr:663850964763279381>
from what
that would be funny
I don't know if any of Shanks' crew has a DF. At least not his main 3 guys
the monkey on the guys shoulder is actually a man with a zoan fruit
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
no
it is
I HOPE
he wasn't scared
you can't spell Luffy without Dragon
he did hit drake
he got yeeeeted
they're not sword
this is still the funniest, good luck sending fodders with riot shields <:LULW:607641487429206106>
I subscribe to the weevil being some artificial frankenstein human
that one
it's goated
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
Here's why Weevil could be a manmade creation like Frankenstein
1. look at the stitches 2. He's dumb af 3. He seems to have just come outta nowhere  4. He could actually have the dna of WB which makes him so strong 5. I can't think of another reason but I wanted 5
when Weevil turns out to be man made don't come crying to me
I will bet on it
yes
cringe
ugggh that's been posted so many times today
and I hate it
üò°
I kill chat all the time
dw about it
<:Crydo:586275183032270849>

I just leave everyone speechless when I say something
that's why chat always "dies"

it's ok
<a:runningemote:735442727239417917>

it's just colors really lol
I could give a shit about the spade pirates
I just like orange
yes
this channel is where you can talk about LITERALLY anything else, so might as well not even bring up anime/manga
well not literally anything else
but you know what i mean
it
it's coz he's invisible üëª
The rules here are perfect imo
you have no idea how annoying it can get when people can just post/say whatever they want
especially on a server this size
I think they're especially fair given how many channels we have for certain subjects
like if you wanna talk about latest one piece stuff, you go into manga
if you don't, you go into other channels
500k?
oh the reddit
nvm
the reddit is how I found this server
and I hardly use the reddit anymore
lol
kept getting muted
eh
I'm on most of the day
it's only really hectic on chapter days in <#164971940648321024>
i don't even bother that much anymore
but they added another manga channel which I thought was a great idea so that's good
last week
or two weeks ago maybe
it just got too crazy
coz yeh we may have 80k members, but only a fraction of that are active during the week, but on chapter day
oh boy
just a swarm
yeh pretty much lol
crazy
> everyone already knows eachother I wouldn't say everyone knows each other, I'm still getting to know a lot of people
There are definitely regulars I talk to frequently
yeh you too
you can call me Evan, JSG, anything really I don't mind
My name normally says Just Some Guy
but ...
^
probably why
yeppers
it's not for everyone
but I like it
yeh it's funny in places
morning fon
I haven't slept at all and it's 6 in the morning
definitely
it works yeh
if you wanna go to jail
If Pinocchio told someone that his nose grows longer every time he tells the truth, people would think he's telling the truth
something to think about

oof
age act
it was a cool concept
<:SengokuPalm:701663557338529802>
kinda a weird joke to make in the first place ngl
is there anything good from wsj besides one piece
bc is not good lol
I should give dr stone a try
bodybuilding manga when?
no way
actually I'm not surprised
lol
I haven't started CSM, but demon slayer and JJK are ass
imagine the competition arcs
just people flexing really hard
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
oh
oh it's womens bodybuilding lol
looks stupid
I've got plenty of sports manga to read so dumbbell nan kil moteru is not a priority
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
oh right
from the bleach guy right?
I can't tell if you actually like Haikyuu or not will lol
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
fair
it's pretty bad
ooooh
I thought the "i fucking hate it" was in response to my question lol
I'm biggay atm
didn't notice it at first
another sports manga?
sorachi still kinda JUST ended as well

I'm currently watching the anime
it's hilarious

speaking of Berserk
I'm gonna go back to reading coz I'm about to finish the conviction arc
cya
most reliable source
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
why is it so unbelievable to think that he can wrap around any living thing within reason? He can literally MOVE
he doesn't need consent
stage 4 happens without fail
every time
TAKE OVER. Kinda implies that he can do it my force
I don't get your argument. You think the fruit is so bad, its only useful if the person complies?
that
that is such a retarded argument
this isn't a productive argument, where both parties are bringing valid arguments to the table. You're just bring half ass arguments and half of them are disguised as memes
THATS NOT RELEVANT TO THIS DISCUSSION AT ALL
also, this isn't me a normal human trying to put a piece of clothing on you. This is me actually BECOMING a jacket and putting myself on you
Zolo
Alex is the type of guy that is the most infuriating to "argue" with
lol
no
because ur points aren't really constructive at all
they're either passive aggressive or memes
and you are also unwilling to see the potential other side
it's like arguing with my brother
yes, please stop ignoring others points to push your brain dead argument. The discussion can't advance because you won't let it
I'm gonna leave before someone gets muted or banned
Doom, I'm not a mod, but I think it would be best to move on. This has seriously just divulged into insults
I hope it is
ok
what does that have to do with anything? lmao

silly Doom
made a mistake
haha
he will be missed ... until he inevitably reappears in a cover story
<a:GutsMegaCry:721314623495733288>
My favorite part of that entire flashback, was that Oden literally invited Franky to be a Roger Pirate, then laughed at him for being an orphan <@!160778857702490113>
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
funniest shit ever
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
coulda been on the crews of 2 pirate kings
but in my factual headcanon, Scopper was the shipwright
lmao Gaben
LUMBERJACK
ü™ì

yeh, so proficient to the point you don't even need to
that's my guess Doom
took a deep breath in
probably had to calm himself
oh god powerscaling characters who we've seen practically nothing from
favorite hobby
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
Shanks vs Mihawk is the most redundant debate ever

speaking of vegito
did you actually say this? Or is this just an edit
I didn't make it, but yeh it's pretty funny
but do you actually believe it
what's "mid admiral level" as well?
ok so it was a joke
good
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
surely not
lmao
<:SengokuPalm:701663557338529802>
k
it's not as bad as someone once saying on here the term "captain level". AS IN, pirate captain level. Literally ranging from Kuro to Kaido
Zeoh what makes you think you can take down Sawyer without going through me first?
"human level"
<:LULW:607641487429206106> <:LULW:607641487429206106> <:LULW:607641487429206106>
this has made my day Doom
<:RogerLaugh:675105907776159744>
it is true tho
one piece fans will literally attach the word "level" to just about anything
and yes bubs
I'd be honored to join the clown army
what are the criteria?
seems pretty elite
Oda LITERALLY told powerscalers to shut the fuck up, but yet they still exist
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
remember there were theories that Roger was super weak
how'd that turn out
lol
retards
but they existed
I would get AC
but
I won't
kettle guy?
Oven

Kettle guy lmao
they should be taken seriously
just not solely for strength purposes
Laww, I'm checking now
I think it was anime only
