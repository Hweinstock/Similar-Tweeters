Most
Probably
Payback war a big yikes 😬
Bruh on God
Every Robin rider
She's so important she's the only one that can read the ponyglyphs
Yeah you're right even we the reader don't know what Robin has read
Why the fuck she on the crew if she doesn't even tell the crew mates what's on the ponyglyphs
She her own historian bruh not even the straw hats
Exactly bro
It's like yeah we know info, can we know it too oda? Nah
Man oda built a whole world filled with so many mysteries
And the one lady who should be solving it all reads the info and doesn't tell us 💀
Legendary beast vibes
> Big mom said if she got Lola to marry Loki that she would have already been pirate king, I think there’s more to that than JUST getting the giants on her side. They may be the key to pluton. The “land” weapon <@345807250109235201>  I disagree this depends on the population of the giant race
Because if there's literally tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands
Bruh it's over
If there's only a couple hundred giants you're probably right tbh
But of the giant island has the population of like a normal island it's over for the marines if they fought
Exactly lmao
It's robin language don't worry
Robin will read it then not tell u what it says
Yeah wait are people saying Pluton isn't a warship?
I thought we were talking about Uranus tbh
Yeah
So do people think the counter to pluton is something that isn't pluton?
Yeah ik I'm confused
I think we're all on the same page but don't realize it lmao
Yup that's what's happening
LMAO I've watched 6 people including myself say the same thing as the person before them
7
Chat confusing sometimes lmao
Bruh are the ponoglyphys just in japanese?
Artur is Robin
Except hotter 👀🥵
It has the word pluton on itn
So younger me didn't think any deeper into it
Damn bruh your name is my reaction to that
> I wonder if Franky did ever memorize the contents of the blueprints <@287712421165137920>  He is a cyborg so maybe
What if Kaido escapes gets pluton then the straw hats need to go to Elbaf to try to get the giants help in creating the pluton copy that franky memorized the blue prints of but then Shanks is there and then cool stuffs happens 😔🙏
Huh?
Strong - Right
It's -
Yeah pretty obvious
Oh no
!headcanon
No
Nah they were just saying what if he memorized it Wow
Because he's cyborg so computer boy
So maybe he memorized it
> FMI is big mom territory , and has a mermaid daughter , she has to have at least heard bout it , them going there will result in a panel of big meme getting eatin by sea kings <:ZoroNut:632474447462400010> <@198930928083402753>  Yes but no, her knowing isn't because of mermaid daughter it's because mud man knows about it and he's a prisoner in wano
> I could always be wrong but I'll look for it Big <@683663101186277416>  Oh I thought we were just theorizing tbh I'm pretty sure Franky never says it
mAyBe
Monkey D who?
!speedreader2 is my favorite
Luffy life span people

My new favorite pic
Yo your kinda memeing too hard
I mean we know
But you hit it kinda hard
Say Kaido blows up the moon
Which moon*
Lmao u read my mind
@Artur which moon kaido blowing up this week 😔

Pug piece poggers
More people there
Everyone going to sleep here
Gotcha
If kissanime doesn't have it I just Google the name of the chapter tbh
Big mom <:ZoroNut:632474447462400010>
Excuses aside I'm actually gonna sleep now lmao GN boys see ya tomorrow
Bruh
Too late for sure
Nah nah the assassin is that super cool looking underworld guy
Yeah but I'm sure the WG hires assassin's and people from the underworld
They legit do underworld slave trading so I'm sure
But luffy 1 shot garp
So
Luffy >>>>>>>>>> Roger
!powerleveling
!powerlevel
Bruh I never remember it
Than you 💀
Lmao
Damn if I was in the one piece world
I'd probably just die
Like just go
And die
Gone bro
Oda ate it
Said yummy yummy Yamato yummy
We've never seen Roger train either tho
He do be stronks
Y'all think we'll ever go to that famous "ice continent"
Sounds like cap coded
Could be true
But sounds like cap
Ice continent has one piece
Nah cap
Lodestar useless
Because the whole point of it is already done
A joke
One piece
Lol bad show
Tekking good
Joy boy is unwatchable to me tbh
Rogers base over reacts to everything tbh
Like 😬
WAAAAH YONKO?!?!?!?
Wa-WHAT
Why did reverie exist if we just never gonna go back to it for like 100 chapters
It's like Robin reading Poneglyphs and not telling anyone what's on it
Oh my bad I meant that actual Reverie
Ik that's also a youtube thing
I don't even know most of these one piece YouTubers tbh
I can't stand watching Rogersbase doing the thing that seizure guy from Avatar does over and over
I can see why a dude who screams and throws his hands around constantly with two half naked women with him can turn weird very fast
Tekking is chill unless he isn't lmao
Then he's kind crazy
Like the Brick was funny at first
But when the brick has been around for this long  👀
I agree Tekking is literally like a real friend
> No, Tekking cant stop screaming in my ears <@274366418223497217>  Just skip past the first minute
Tekking post intro is great
I mean I like tangents tbh
The worst cringe that is unbearable is always in the beginning
I usually just skip it and it's a great video
Like haha Break special affects haha weird break
Which I enjoy more than a 20 minute video of reading a script
Yeah I'd rather watch teking go on tangents than someone boringly say points for a few minutes with no actual personality
I watch videos for entertainment tekking does that
Yeah for sure curious
I've never seen him
Nux is tekking + Rogers base
Hes literally them combined
With a lil bit of 2spooky
hElLo
I like podcast but a one piece podcast sounds kinda 😬
Artur is Odas son confirmed?!?
Yeah tekkings name is matt
Wait wtf
He was tryna spoil mark?
I'll fucking kill them
Totally not mark is such a precious thing
A childish glow
Ah so just the joke of "haha u not caught up so I spoil"
This week
Yeah zeph he's just going on a week break
He's still probably doing post marine ford after the break
That seems like a lot to cover
Yeah but Marine ford has more substance and emotional value than those too arcs combined
Some were good tho
Ending 1 is literally a master piece
As a kid, I never stopped Searching for a great treasure I had a map in my mind That I knew would lead me
Fire
Oh no is the pacing bad?
I'm finally gonna watch the anime again
Don't tell me the pacing is bad in wano 😬
> get ready for yonko level batman <@!521783526878609418> <@703504844903940096>  You mean Apoo?
Oh you literally mean the batman
Like the smileuser
Wtf
I barely even remember him lmao
<:WBeardWhat:638862189771620372>  is what I would say if I've heard them
But I haven't heard them so idk
Yeah I'd say a lil less than 1
DBZ be like .01 chapters per episode
Do big mom's children all have daddy issues?
Daddy perospero 🤤
Well that's why you have Daddy issues because of the lack there of one
Well sometimes
No male role model type vibes
I mean sometimes
It could also be from having a shitty dad
Artur is basically Morgan's
I think the way it works is either the government puts a bounty on you and they pay for it or probably another group can be the ones to pay for the bounty set on you by the government and they could also probably decide dead or alive, dead only, or alive only as they're the ones paying for it not the WG
The bounties can't be decided by you but you could probably decide to be the one to pay for it if you're rich enough and decide on the status of it
I think theres boards of people that review what people do and decide bounties not people like the admirals
And I'm sure the WG can raise them if they think that they need to be dealt with asap
So they didn't know Garp was dragons dad
Wouldn't that raise suspension about Garp if his son is THE most wanted man alive
> Sengoku told garp that if he wasn’t the hero of the marines then He woulda been held responsible for the actions of his family <@564773067969265674> Ah that makes sense
Wait
Let me ask a big brain question
Didn't they know dragons last name?
Did they know garps?
Nah the Navy
Yeah that makes way more sense
But they knew Luffys name
So everyone knew immediately that he was Garps grand son
So Dragons wanted poster probably didn't have Monkey D until after Marineford
Idk I'm sure they still knew his name tbh
Im tryna see Dragon wanted poster still 😔
Bruh I'm dumb
I just spead read that pannel
!speadreader2
Nah
Nah stop
My Luffy X Yamato was just ruined
Might kms not sure
Will lyk
I mean fodder is fodder but Zoro vs all the marine fodder at marineford
I'd still give it to the Marines
All of em fone
An army of fodder isn't fodder anymore tbh
Nah sinji just goes sKy wAlK and eats shit and dies
Yeah you right
But an army of fodder is stronger than most non fodder characters
Strawhat grand fleet isn't even a grand fleet because it doesn't even exist
It's literally months travel away from each otherb
How the fuck they gonna act quickly if something happens
Luffy one sec bro let me circumnavigate half of the grandline
Give me half an arc bro
Ideo cool
Y'all shit on Ideo but will argue me to death about a fucking jacket I swear to fucking god
A cool different race of people long armed boxer that can make things explodes with his FIST? Nah bro this man is a jacket and trust jackets can force themselves onto someone believe me I'm a sentient jacket myself
I like him just because he's a long arm and I like the idea of all the races under Luffys command
Also boom boom fist kinda epic
!hack
Ideo has a cool design tho tbh
Jumped on the wiki and he kinda epic bro
Ignore my bookmark bar
Ideo more of a satisfying design than most dressrosa characters
Dressrosa was The age of the Fodder
Homie has a unique way of using his long arms unlike any other long arm we've seen
Ideo > Orlumbus
If Orlumbus didn't have an army of fodder he'd literally be a big dude who goes bowling
Mr. 5 is one of the best characters in one piece
On ChouChou level tbh
What else he gonna chose?
His explosions hurt him no?
Oh then why doesn't he just blow up his fist like Ideo
I always thought the reason he threw his boggys was because it'd hurt him
Explosive headbutts
When is Ace getting out of Impel Down tho
He's been there so long
I mean he has the blue fire
Would look even cooler tbh
Nah Logias can't hurt themselves
Nah thriller bark
Vs Ryuma
Unless you wanna call that just a heat attack that set Ryuma on fire
That he didn't actually create the fire
And just heat
Ichiji powers kinda wack tbh I didn't fully get it
Yeah the anime made it blue
Ig it could've been red
But in my mind it's blue
There could also be chemicals on Ryuma dead body that would turn the fire a different color
Wait no one answered my question a while back
Brooks cold powers from his devil fruit right?
Because instagram spead readers attacked me for thinking that
Said it was "his sword from the devil people"
Like bro you know those swords that give you ice powers like huh?
Exactly Fleeb
That was my argument
But they were like no bro the devil worshippers gave him that power
!speedreader2
Its not even headcanon if it's explained to be wrong
LMAO
Yeah
Right after thriller bark is when I switched from anime to manga
I reread until then at some point
And watched up to Zou too
I watched most of WCI but not all I read it weekly but couldn't watch it all
Joyboy voice makes me feel no good
I also didn't like a video he made like years ago so I just never watched it
Yeah I like his art style
Makes sense that's why you're shit
Or the art he uses my bad
It matches his pfp so cool theme thing
Wait what
That's a bruh moment
Is he even a mink tho tbh he just a monkey
Like it's just a monkey with a hat
Mink are humanoid animals
This monkey thing is just a monkey with clothes on
Ah fair enough
But still this monkey just a monkey
> Yamato can read poneglyphs from studying Odens Journal <@521427565492305931>  Damn maybe when she reads it she'll actually tell us what's on them unlike fucking Robin
Yamato replace Robin? 🤤 Yes please
Nah he just crouching
He T bagging luffys dead grandma
Why u think Garp so mad for
Xebec just no scoped his girl
If Robin is luffys step mom I'll leave
Like not the chat just everything
I'll just leave
!fodder
Someone make that
That was the best one piece pun I've ever heard
Lmao

Me when I see a sanjitard
Top 5 weakest scientist?
Nah
Garp was a good dad just not strict
So he did the opposite with Luffy and beat the shit out of him
I don't remember if it's a bib or not but I remember it looking like a cigar
I think it's just oda drawing cool or like powerful eyes
I don't think they're connected
Hakuba confirmed Mihawk and Imu sun
My bad bro
Lmao
Imu Sama? Tbh he's like mid warlord level maybe low admiral high yonko 6th commander type strength
I mean it's literally in his epithet
Hawkeye
Caribou Celestial?!?
I think it's just Oda going "I draw eye like this"
!hack
There's some things that I think are seeds set by Oda but some eyes idk
That I can see a connection with
Mihawk and Hakuba not so much
And Mihawk had the epithet I think that's the extent of that
The zunesha and Imu thing has a much stronger link that I wouldn't be surprised if ran seller
Nah Zunesha been wondering before the void century I'm pretty sure
Yeah and that's why he won't get it because it'd be so good
I think the sensing the presence thing isn't an ussop exclusive like someone said
Yeah someone either here or on instagram said it was a unique thing like katakuri future sight and it was a speed reader moment
Yeah it's just how Oda represented it at that moment
Yeah I got that feel too Costa
Nah I think literally everyone can
I think it's just how it was represented in that moment
I'm sure if Sanji was in Ussops place he could also see them
Them being sugar
Yeah exactly
Idk the specialities thing doesn't really sit right with me I think someone can train it more than others but I think any of the monster trio could have seen what Ussop saw in that moment
Yeah and maybe during Wano
My ex played softball and could flex her cheeks
😔
Sad times
Gonna go kaido myself to sleep
It's kaido times boys
I gotta stop myself from saying chef stuff
It's so easy to go on culinary tangents
Salt piece
Damn I rushed to find my favorite dessert but could only find a pic of like half of it and you guys aren't even on dessert anymore
😔 sad stuff
Blue
All?
Blue
All blue?
Someone call sanji and tell em it's right here in this server
No way I know Oda
@Artur
Sanji and Zoro are kinda just Strawhat fodder tbh
Oh they fought the unimportant 2nd and 3rd strongest
Wow how cool
Ussop? Character development
Chopper? Perfect
What an I saw I'm a literary genius myself f
Suuuuuper
Yeah obviously
Ben who?
You mean 800 chapters ago
Relevant people only please
Lmao what
Joy boy in spanish
Huh
How can I be fodder if I'm the main character of my own life <:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
<:ZoroWeary:701983967041159169>
People who say Sanji is a good character !speedreader2
Fuxk
FUCK
Aight I failed I'm done for tonight

That's me
I'm so scared
Thank u jugol
!speedreader2 is better because it takes up less space lmao
Smaller boy helps convo stay readable for me
Wtf is happening
Sanji also is over sexualized
PROSTITUTES?!? Sorry Wano war I have better things to do <:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
Bruh even a nosebleed troupe here and there isn't that that annoying
But when he's legit a sexually predator 😬
Imagine if Sanjis character was more focused on his cooking stuff and his cool side
He would be way better
But instead we get predator chef
Yeah it's over some for no reason
As a chef Sanji would be probably my favorite anime character if he actually was a chef and not a sexual predator that sometimes cooks
Yeah I mean we could chalk it up to Japan having a different culture and sense of humor around sexualization
But idk even then 😬
Sanji:" I spent 2 years training not only my fighting skills like the other monster trio but my actual cooking skills and am able to create dishes that might change the way a fight goes because it can boost people's physical abilities" *comes back to crew See's a woman never does anything else
Like bruh the fact he did more than do fighting training is so cool
Then oda went
Nah
Boobs
Legit such a cool concept at least to me especially with the whole point being to boost people's physical abilities
Nah the recipes weren't just normal food
They were supposed to be like secret enhancing foods
Once since the time skip?
He spent the time skip learning that
Imagine if luffy used haki twice
That's why I don't remember the punk hazard one
I don't even remember the punk hazard one
And I had no idea about the cake cream
It just is a really cool concept especially when fighting a yonko crew to give them some sort of edge over them
Lmao
Puns
I don't remember either tbh
But still twice in non important ways
If they just had the cake filling be normal cake filling that wouldn't have changed anything
The punk hazard thing sounds more relevant tbh but I can't remember so I'ma look that one up
Yeah the first one sounds like a good example tbh
But the cake thing is literally just cake filling
Ive always enjoyed the aspect of sanji that is he's not a fighter
Can he fight? Yes
Is that his goal? No
So the idea of him being able to make these 99 recipes that can completely change the way a fight goes is so cool to me
Yeah the cake thing kinda dumb tbh
The punk hazard one works
But that's still only 2 in the like 8 years since the time skip
Something being so sweet to take someone out isn't a cool recipe that can physically enhance the crew to change the way a fight goes
And if that didn't exist the arc wouldn't have gone any different at all
Literally just say Sanji made a good filling
Why would they just randomly eat it? And he's also never used it like that
I mean if he used it like that
Then that would be awesome
But he just hasn't
I would love to see him do that > <@!521783526878609418> It can decrease enemy forces <@415999229564157955>
But the fact that it's not a relevant thing in post time skip sanji sucks
I agree I meant the way he used it didn't seem as relevant as the punk hazard one
Imagine an arc where sanji was a serious character? That's one of the reasons why I like WCI tbh
Sanji wasn't a gag throughout the whole thing
The majority of the arcs? No
Like time wise in each arc I mean
Getting serious for like 1 fight and spending the whole time going 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
I mean Wano is an extreme example so I won't really use that
Like that's more of an outlier tbh
Leaving the raid for prostitutes
Yeah and when he does I like it
But it doesn't happen until key moments in arca
Arcs*
He's either goofy or just existing
I mean Luffy as well
But his goofy isn't creepy
I think the type of goofy is the problem
Is sneaking into a women's bath while naked goofy or just being a sexual predator?
Sanjis an adult
Not a child
He's a strawhat
I mean I agree
I like the pirates have loose morals
But it's a shonen and the reoccurring theme is that the straw hats are different
#Yamato>Carrot
😴
Let's not go off giving Oda head
Dam
I built different
I wasn't
I mean he's a grand fleet member that's good enough
More barto is good I agree but him joining the straw hats themselves would be lil too much
His gag would grow to be too annoying
Marco strawhat?
Nah jk lmao
Yeah Jinbei fills that roll
I think more characters will join the grandfleet then crew
Carrot a grand fleet commander to me
Yamato girl then marries luffy
Yeah I think so
Vega such a non character character
Yeah bro this guy you've never seen in the 21 year long manga exist but he's so smart and can do literally everything
Vegapunk is like a shadow that we all know exist and will probably meet one day
We just accept it and ignore the shadow
Sword
Reinforcements
> Does sword have the ssg weapons? <@683663101186277416>  I don't think so
> Do you guys think any of the straw hats would eat a devil fruit <@346692838328893452>  Monet fruit theory still cool
> Why would they come to Wano? <@683663101186277416> they have dealings with wano, it's their source for seaprism probably
I'm not 100 on them coming but I don't think it's impossible
The WG have
And the WG control the marines
CP meeting with Orochi to make deals
They trade
That wasn't the first time they were there tho
They have traded in the past
That's how orochi got ships and guns and stuff
Nah he literally says the WG got him ships and weapons
It's in the CP meeting
The WG doesn't really need money tho
This happened so long ago so I literally can't remember what the CP asked for
Orochi wanted Vega in return
Yeah no lol but that's what he wanted
We know that Wano is a huge sea prism  stone place so it would make some sense if the Navy got it from there but that's just my head canon
I think BB makes more sense than the navy
I think some 3rd party will appear towards the end
BB or Shanks makes more sense than the Navy to me
Yeah and shanks coming would lead into the final safa
But also that's a marine ford repeat
Wouldn't be surprised would be sad
Pudding gets kidnapped by BB
Because no one there to protect her besides Kat
Kat teams up with straw hats to fight BB along side bigmom troops that support Kat
Nothing's Necessary it's a manga
This is all about what's likely
And as a shonen the older generation fan favorite character is shanks which means he immediately has a higher chance of dying
Big mom territory attack would work for that
A Katakuri luffy team up against BB would be sick
Luffy for his brother Kagakuri for his sister
Doflamingo?
He knows secrets
> ok doffy keeps saying "oh there is this secret" why not just tell it? > he is already locked up. <@212265078739828737>  He has more power by not just saying it
I think he's gonna kidnap Pudding
She's a third eye tried
^
Especially if BB wants that secret too so he helps him get out in exchange for the secret
Yeah probably not but it's better than no power
Also who's he gonna tell the secret to in impeldown?
Lmao yeah
Yeah I think a BB kidnaping Pudding, so Katakuri needs to attack him but doesn't have enough fire power to right a yonko crew so he asks Luffy for help and Luffy obviously agrees after Ace would be an amazing Last Saga kick off before the end end, anything with BB would also attract Shanks.
BB caused Ace death
Luffy fighting him for his brother Kat for his sister
I think a relationship between Kat and pudding would've been cooler than with brulee
Battle royal all the one piece youtubers who lives?
Bonus round including Artur and Oda
Garp didn't betray the organization he's worked for for more than half a century?!?
It makes more sense that he didn't save him than if he did
What's more important a promise or literally the thing he's dedicated his entire life to?
Would you throw away your entire life over a promise with a deadman?
Bro we talking about science if this a tekking video
> <@521783526878609418> if that was the case then he didn't have to take Ace under his wing <@631190162566676480>  Taking Ace as his grandson doesn't do against his entire lifes career
The sins of a father don't transfer to the child
But then Ace became an actual pirate
He had his own crimes
Yeah and he also tried forcing them into the marines so they wouldn't become pirates
Garp worked hard so bother Luffy and Ace wouldn't be defined by their fathers crimes, but both ignored Garp and allowed themselves to be difened by their OWN grimes
Garp good guy
He gets shit but that discussion destroyed him
Yeah if science applied then the one piece world would only have 1 moon
👀
What?
Who Bartos? No
Kizarus light attacks are physical lazers
If you get a strong material that happens to be see through and shoot it with a lazer then it doesn't just go through
Lasers don't work off of sight they are a physician force
There's a difference between refraction off of something like a mirror an a material just being transparent
Bartos barrier is transparent doesn't mean a lazer goes through but
This is so conpli
I'm probably gonna start a a one piece dnd campaign soon if anyone in here what's to join lmk
Lmao are u for real or playing?
Can we start a good argument in here like some jacket jacket fruit stuff
One that boils on for like half an hour and really gets people going
He is
Ussop cute 🤤
Haha xd just playing tehehehe
Lmao
Too sarcastic for this channel?
Well
He drinks
And he uh fights yonkos? And he stops wars
I'd say shanks is actually the manifestation of power scalers as an actual character and his goal is to keep balance among the power scaling
For the sake of power scaling
Can't have Kaido being pirate king level
Only yonko lebel
He keeps balance in the scales
!fish
Nah I wanna fish
!fish
!adventure new

Nah
<:ShanksYes:727411684095819856>
Unless you're a girl then he tries to sexually assault u
Wym bruh Zoro literally bathes all the time
You ain't see his ass training in water falls ever 5 minutes bruh that's  freshwater that's clean shit
Luffy and zoro are very different
Chopper smells like fresh meat
Ussop smells like BITCH
Franky smells like America
Shit
Just shit
A bad person
The fresh winds of a summer that doesn't even do their one job on the ship
Poneglyph? You mean the thing that I'm here for because I can read them? Yeah I'm not gonna tell anyone on my crew what it says 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Robin quirky 🤪
Like a manly fish
Like a shark
Testosterone + Fish
Testosterone
They have insane amounts of it
Brook would bath but he doesn't have skin to wash because he's just a bag of bones! yohohoho
Sanji is disgusting
Sanjitard 🤮
Sanji literally would rape a woman
Sanji wanted to do the same thing
!speesreader2
!speedread2
Fuck
I can never do it
I'm too dumb
Did I type spees? LMAO
Bruh moment
Speed typed be like 😔
Don't they eat the fish from their?
Sustainable farm fishing?
Yamato always bathing, in Odens glorry 😔
What
Huh
😬
I'm a yamato fan boy and even I don't think of her armpits
👀
Eyes
Always
The windows into the soul
Everything you needs know about someone from their ey w
That's how I know Mihawk a celestial dragon bro
Eyes 😔
When we get to the one piece and oda lied and it is just the friendship they shared along the way 😔

King according to who Oda? LMAO the hack
!hack
Nah he did say it
But he's also a hack
Omg
I haven't laughed that hard in a minute
Looks like a 1st grader
Oda what's happened
Robin the bad historian
The I won't share any information I find on these legendary poneglyphs we've found together Robin?
I'm at 1% good bye men
Been a good life with all of u
It's not even the feet
It's just the toes
Nvm
I looked at Odens
Maybe it's like my hero and special people have special toes
Wait did I just make a comment on another show?!?
<#206841928019476491> police
Thank you bro 😔
It's ok ik the consequences
I die here
But scars on a one piece fans back are a shame
So only my front 😔
Tried to*
Big Akainu assumptions there
I came up with an epic story for my one piece dnd I'm excited boys
No that would go against luffys main characteristics
Luffy doesn't have to become a boring planner for have matured
There's a difference between maturing in someone's own way and becoming a different character
Luffy will never be law
But luffy is also more mature than he was when he started
Gaben that's tuff
Just use a phone bro
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
Cringhe cringe
Got em 😎 typo
It kinda looks like him tbh
But also did u see marco in the chapter
He didn't look like a fucking human at all
That was a demonic creature not marco
Im just saying we can't deduce either way for sure because oda is a hack
Like someone send the marco and pero pannel
It's legit curvy lines
Bruh
Wtf
Homie that shit is 6ft long
Literally everyone in jump force is ugly
Jump force isn't a pretty game
Or a good game
An cc one piece game would be amazing
Xenoverse 2 is vastly superior to Jump force tbh
I'm not a xenoverse fan boy but it's just better
A one piece xenoverse would samck
That's too good
The thing of dreams
I mean everyone also wanted a naruto CC
But then it happened
And 😬
Yeah sea of thieves is good now
But as someone who played the early beta
Bruh moment
Even the released version
Bruh
Y'all wanna go get a chest? Yeah. Y'all wanna do it again? Yeah. Again? Yeah 😔.
I mean yeah but also crews in sea of thrives are actual players no Npc
I like that better
Tbh the open world one piece game wasn't bad
The difficulty setting was dumb tbh
It was either insanely easy
Or insanely hard in some areas
When u play as Zoro and Sabo I mean
Luffy was always easy mode
Nah Mip even in the hardest difficulty it's straight up boring at times
Like legit there's areas that are ok I did it
Yeah I think so
And then u walk into an areas and go oh when did I die?
I don't remember I got the season pass I think
I think law is out so I'ma try him actually
Release was 60
Idk about now
Also all the dlc is like built in basically
So the downloads for it are 10 MB
Ima play world seekers rn
Idk PW never really my thing didn't play it
But open world is so world seekers was amazing to me
Should I get PW4?
Isn't the game play just killing fodders?
Yeah looks kinda boring tbh
A custom character game would be epic
But also I don't want it to be, you join straw hats cool
Shinobi strikers was such a good skeleton but terrible insides

World seeker so good looking
Like the way everything flows
Physics engine in the game is amazing
Actually experiencing how the sunny looks like and doing parkwar all over it and the characters all to scale is so cool
Jinbei Robin better
Y'all speed readers on God
Oh did he release marineford?
Let me work out then I'll watch it over lunch
Robin and Jinbei are literally both mature intelligent adults and have better chemisty
Headcanon
😎 got em
He's blue boy
Green no good
Also french dumb
😎
LMAO
Bruh
Yeah the english translation is much better
I wouldnt say plane more like just minimum
Law goes "It's kaido"
When I'm the english I'm sure he says something cooler
But with a different fruit <:WBeardWhat:638862189771620372>
My story for my one piece dnd campaign epic
omg
I've made a discovery with the Eye theory
Ok so some of you compare Mihawks, Imu sama, and Zuneshas eyes because they're all like orangish and have an iris unlike most other eyes of males
I've found an official Image that basically references this eye and ties it to Roger and the One Piece
one sec
I dont have a still image of it it's in a video so i gotta screenshot it on my phone and send it 1 sec
Yes those same eyes
tying it to the pirate treasure

It's not exactly the same but this is from legit like 15 years ago
so Idk pretty similar
wekk
well
It's from the Pirate Rap.
The best song in one piece history
LMAO
Yes it's Rogers eyes but also the eyes of the pirate who seeks the One piece
not just Roger
Tying it to the voices of all things maybe
Are they?
Yellow and Irises
and also Rogers
These aren't just random eyes
these are Rogers and the eyes of anyone seeking the great pirate treasure
I don't even care about the eye theory tbh
but
any way for the pirate rap to come into play in a relevant way is amazing.
Tell me those Eyes don't look like Imus
Someone send Imus eyes
Why can't you just appreciate the pirate rap
When am I gonna find a girl that likes one piece 😔 like how u gonna like volleyball anime and my hero and not one piece
What crew mates touched each other?
Instant love
Bruh
Just had someone on instagram tell me because Mihawk didn't kill buggy that means haki doesn't affect DF users 😔
Sanji boy
Plot twist Im sama is actually a good person
Fuck us for assuming the worst
He stabbed luffys bounty poster because he's bad that a good guy like him has a bounty
Proof? How do we know they've destroyed anything
Yeah Oda has used pronouns that can work for either gender
Dam the Duval VA has Covid
Sad time
Why did WB join rox in the first place
We saw even when he was super young all he wanted was still a family
Family doesn't sound like Rox crew they
Nah that was Roger
Rocks had da baddies
Roger ain't got no babes
It took him so long to get Rouge
LMAO
Izo
Lmao
What'd I miss
Did the mods go on a perge?
The will of D the natural enemy to Discord mods
I agree
👀
If only everyone in <#164971940648321024> joined my one piece DnD 😔
I'm excited to watch it
Nah luffy doesn't think like that
As far as luffy is concerned he killed his brother that's it
