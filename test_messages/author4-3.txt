Ninja? <#206841928019476491>  grrrrr
> drifting a bit. Can BM give life to Moriah's zombies or can Moriah steal BM's homiws' shadows <@394081111686381568>  No
She can't put souls in human bodies
Idk that's devil fruit level stuff
> Well what if you need some people to operate something? <@131218004540129280>  Threaten them
If your COC is strong enough to mind control people you're probably known enough that the same random weakling would be scared ASF of u and do what u say anyways
On God lmao
Damn a fishman logis user kinda epic
Imagine if Jack was good
LMAO
Nah jack cool tbh
He's under rated
Imagine Jembei with a mythical zoan literally a god
Exactly
Yeah because he can still control water
Df or not he could still use most of fish man karate
Smoke?
Get high?
Yeah Marcos fruit my favorite it's basically all 3 types in 1
Literally all 3 types in 1 fruit I think Marco would be like way stronger if he didn't limit himself to just a commander
I'm not sure what exactly I meant either but let me try to explain
Nah
Lmao never said he's weak
I think if he was a captain he'd have more responsibility and have to strive to be better and stuff if that makes sense
That's true enough
Idk i feel like if Marco did what most of the other people did that we saw in the oden flash back and left and made his own crew under the WB alliance I think he'd be stronger
Not automatically but I think without someone like white beard with him 24/7 he would have to go through more stuff that would eventually lead to him being a stronger person
Not only responsibilities but literally having to go on an adventure on his own
Like imagine if Luffy instead of making his own crew just joined someone else's
> Like imagine if Luffy instead of making his own crew just joined someone else's <@521783526878609418>  I genuinely don't think he'd be who he is today
Ik and Marco is literally my top 5 favorite characters
He'd always try to take over like ussop in the beginning
What if Luffy and akainu died protecting Ace from white beard
> I would like to see Ace as the main character ngl <@634490470768050204>  Lmao it happened already
He has his novels
Marco > Every other yonko crew member besides Katakuri
Ace is just fire Luffy
Everything Ace did Luffy would do if he was just a tad bit more mature and was able to fallow someone else
And his respect for WB
Ace was a device but I also think he was a lovable character
Pasta.... Did you just fix anime?
Yeah the wano thing cool
<:aFeelsAceMan:586371608382537759>
Imagine if that fight happened with today's animation and art style? <:AkainuSweat:586408945137090571>
> What did ace achieve ? As a character <@564773067969265674>  He was known enough to be a warlord
Warlord status is a good indication tbh
> <@521783526878609418>  yeah but I mean what did he do within the time we see him ? <@564773067969265674>  I haven't read the novels so I really don't know but there's probably good stuff in there
I just know he did enough for a warlord status and to become a commander in WB crew
Wow not stupid
Sabo = Ace
Maybe Sabo a lil better
Oda actually wrote Ace and thought, " I'm gonna make him with 0 character and no substance other than Luffy lmao then I'll KILL HIM OFF LMAO"
As long as no one shits on Marco or Zoro idc tbh
<@564773067969265674> I want you to know the way you feel about Ace is the way I feel about Carrot
Not starting a Carrot argument here I'm just saying the things you're saying about Ace are the same things I feel about Carrot
Ace hate is so weird it's like people skipped Alabasta and Impel down and Marineford and 3D2Y
Everyone can have their opinion lmao
I'm just saying the way u feel about Ave is how I feel about Carrot
I like her just don't think she has substance and character but also I don't wanna argue this again because we did this yesterday lmao
LMAO
Substance= The amount of unique emotional value and characteristics that make that character not only invaluable to us as the reader but makes them an integral part in the one piece story or at least a part of it
Katakuri literally best antagonist
At least for me
I love Bigmom too she has great layered personality
She isn't just big strong villain
She's also someone who values people of all different races
But is also an asshole
But also has an actual disorder
But also lost her memory and became a lovable character
Big mom has more character and would be a better strawhat than Carrot <:ZoroWeary:701983967041159169>
Lmao
What bigmom is not an edgy swordsmen or dragon? Bad character grrr
Yeah some people in the community thrive on what's "cool" and hate everything that isn't as edgy as them
Katakuri is just overall awesome and a great juxtaposition to luffys character
Ace and Brulee
juxtaposition between Kat and Luffy is why Oda even went as far as to retcon the type of devil fruit he uses
Yeah like I said bigmom a great character
> I’m convinced half the fandom can’t take a character seriously if they’re not clad in bdsm gear or have 12-16 sets of Abs <@521427565492305931>  LMAO
Jimbei just pushed her
Is it that strange that one of the strongest Warlords pushed a hunger pain big mom?
If you hit someone and all it did was make them go in the other direction that's a push
I mean like she wasn't hurt she didn't complain
Oh lmao nah
Legit just pushed her back that doesn't make her weak
People thinking Jembei fudder so they think Big mom fudder cause he just pushed her back
Jembie third strongest warlord in the beginning
Nah
I think Doofy second strongest probably
Mihawk strongest
I forgot Kuma but may I think he's probably either = or weaker than Jembei
> Boa is stronger than Jimbei tbh <@708065448637497406>  Depends on the opponent
Nah I don't think so maybe jembei has a like 10/100 chance
> what the hell is warlord 4 level <@521427565492305931>  LMAO I fucking hate when people do this
Yeah Luffy actually only 6th yonko commander advizer 8 warlord level Max tbh
Kizaru if he was a warlord
Literally Jembeis only wins against Doofy if he has the ocean
If they by the water then jembei has a way better chance
> Jinbei with at least a cigar is def commander advisor level <@131218004540129280>  Fo sure unless he gets 2 cigars then maybe mid 5th commander advisor level
LMAO
Post time skip Morgan's level tbh
Pre time skip Morgan's ain't shit
Lmao

If only Sanji wasn't such a sexual predator and was more of his calm cool chef side he'd be one of the best characters
Damn 😔
Guess I'll kms now
Sanji good except for an over used dumb troupe
Tbh I could beat Zoro in a 1 v 1
But I'm just built different 😴
Yeah we just built different
> <@153273023456083969>  :0 do itttt <@477218487903977483>  Nah he don't have to Kin about to 1 v 1 him
Yo ik this ain't the right channel but this where's the most amount of people, so if anyone wants to do a one piece DnD I'd be down tbh
One piece dnd would be sick do anyone down dm me and we can make a chat
Raizo is high warlord level tbh he is a ninja
> One Piece dnd would be cool <@670057078064152577>  I'ma send it in the general chat too to see if anyone else wanna do it
Hey everyone
If anyone interested in doing a one piece dnd lmk
Yeah this is the anime chat
There's a manga chat and a catching up chat
Oh yeah why I came here from the manga channel
If anyone interested in doing a one piece dnd hmu
I'm trying to find a DM too so I don't have to do it but I'll dm if I have to
Ik there's a one piece dnd series on YouTube with tekking so I'ma watch that for ideas
I'll also ask the DnD discord if anyone there with experience wants to join and DM
The more the merrier
What we getting on?
I'll join in
Same
I'll bet that carrot won't join the crew and if she does all of you could decide my new name
Idc either way lmao
How about 6 months
Fleebles you betting against me?
Lmao for what?
Damn
I've already lost
Why?
Damn a punishment for losing a bet is just not talking in this chat for 3 days?
Bro that's a w
Exactly lmao
Even better
Damn if only
What's the bet tho
Yamato joining is a good one tbh but it could be a while before we know
Damn Vivi a baddy
That's cool
<:LuffyPeepo:632458634638524435>
Yeah I think there's a reason Marco isn't fighting him
Can someone send the panel with them together on the beach
Marco and pero
What
Oh
What they doing wtf
Why's it say bam
Nah they far away
Of course I can barely see them
Jack make no sense tbh
How is that his normal fishman form
Jack wyd bro
U ain't even a fishy fishman
You forgot me
Fuck I  had a pic of me after working out my shoulders and my neck looked huge
I looked like that one meme of the guy with the tiny head
Lmao
Sanji 😔
Literally has legs in his name
> I have to wait a week and 3 days for next chapter <@306372168827273216>  Damn u do why? That sucks bro
Makes sense
Yeah Marco was 15 or something
😔
Me
My neck huge
Bb also a kid
> all wb commanders are of equal status there is no first mate <@703504844903940096>  Nah Marco
Marco the golden boy
Wtf
Zoro
||This is the manga why we have spoiler bars 😔 ||
Yeah I'm oda
I said that
Trust
Nvm Pasta is oden now
Go ahead Pasta
How are they made
I liked your joke Kamui
My bad Kamui I meant <@698761447835959337>
Time out did Oda just draw Jembei as a fish?
We just gonna ignore that
Jinbei my bad guys
Cases
That's what y'all catching
LMAO
Ik right
No that he's a fish
Oohh t
I never read the sbs myself I just watch videos on it
So in the one piece DnD they just take away everything that isn't in one piece instead of adding things besides devil fruits
If anyone wants to play hmu I'ma start planning the campaign soon
White beard wtf
White beard long white hair
Whi D beard
Lmao
Ight I need like 5 more people for a one piece DnD campaign
Lmao
It's just like the moon exploding
God dam
I think big mom herself is more terrifying but as a whole I think the beast pirates are worse just because of the terrible shit they're doing to the people of Wano
Hey guys I don't remember for sure so clarify for me why Zoro personality is better than Sanji?
LMAO
I like Jinbei better than both of them tbh
I generally prefer Zoro more as Sanji can be creepy and just unfunny to me
Again that's just my opinion
But when I find something creepy even if Zoro is just cool I prefer him
Yeah if Oda liked Sanji more WCI would've been Sanji doing cool shit
WCI is just "bro Sanji blocked Katakuri jelly beans so he's yonko commander level easy"
"Sanji destroyed Oven so he can beat Yonko commanders no problem"
> <@!521783526878609418> sanji's goal isn't focused on fighting though, he wants to find the all blue. Plus WCI emphasised his cooking skills more than his fighting because thats a central part of his character <@375397668727291911>  I agree 100% but I'm just saying what Sanji cock riders have told me
You can enjoy samji and not think he's super strong
I love sanjis character besides the over sexualization doesn't mean I think he's super op
Tbh Sanjis 3D2Y shit was kinda weird, liked all he did was run and learn new recipes so he learned haki and skywalk?
Sanji learned all those cool boosting recipes and haven't shown them at all
As I'm a chef I was excited to see how Sanji uses the special hormonal vitamin body enhancing cooking he learned and it hasn't been mentioned at all
Nothing happened would be better if Zorotards didn't ruin it so much
I think it's better than any scene Sanji has had tho
I'd chose Luffy Sanji Zoro tbh
Or maybe Sanji Zofot Jinbei
Lmao yeah that's why I changed it for jinbei lmao
LMAO wtf
Zoro be like
Nothing happened
Ussop would still be lying and that girl would be dead
Besides movies yeah
And maybe raid clothes will be amazing if they have the same clothes as in the opening
Sanji has straight up a movie style red suit thing in the intro
Scars do disappear over time
Nah I mean 2 year time slip
And the one piece world is different
Teeth grow back with milk
!speedreadee
Fuck
Readee
LMAO
Rip this chat
!headcanon
Toki? I only remember relevant characters
Any characters from more than 20 chapters ago that don't play any roll don't live in my brain no more
Zolo 3 is great
Damn it'd be cool to have all the box sets but they kinda 100 each
I have the money for it but like idk bruh it's kinda free
Lmao
Apoo yonko level
Simple
Yeah
Fuck
!apoo
Damn it'd be so cool if everyone started a one piece dnd with me 😴
Robin?
More like boring
Zoro x Robin? More like Edgy + Slightly attractive = soooo cool
I mean I'm not but ok
I literally do nothing but make fun of edgy people
Yeah ight
Not that's spicy
Chopper awesome
Brook is awesome too but what has he done
I disagree chopper played an integral roll in the bigmom amnesia thing
> he secured us our second Road Poneglyph <@153273023456083969>  Nah I mean in Wano
WCI brook a legend
Yeah but Volume 97 almost is
My bad so my point stands why would he be on the cover if he ain't do nothing in 97
Luffy does drink
When he wants to
Case in point romance dawn he drank juice
> Is the last road poneglyph lost <@564773067969265674>  Yeah I'm pretty sure
I'm thinking Elbaf tbh
And maybe sone old Roger pirates will be at Lodestar or something
Dam I called someone a channel nazi in another server and they tried getting me banned
Bruh what's wrong with people
It's a joke referring to the fact that people are too strict over something as stupid as a Discord channel
That'd be epic
Kaido dragon with a sword
We need a cube reader tho
Fuck
Jack is such a cool idea tbh
A fishman zoan user
Nah that was just a weird peramicia
I can't spell for shit my bad boys
Yeah I can ace a standardized test but a spelling test I'm garbage
When the ap literature test said they weren't checking spelling
W

Epic cover
Pugs

Forgot to crop it lmao
Sanji using a gun is so good
Kicks and gunshots
Damn that's sick
Garp Piece
<:Garpathetic:454408355109273600>
Lmao
Tbh idk what would be more interesting out of the 3 Ds
Each a huge part of the 3 main factions of the world
What faction will Luffys child end up in?
If he has one*
Lmao
Maybe politician 👀
A pacifist D
Focus on Revere and stuff
Dealing with the long after math of however this story ends
> if luffy marries vivi , then maybe <@328936254978916352>  Yeah lol that's where I was drawing from
Manga politics is cool add
I've only read kingdom
Oh shit did I just say that? Where's the <#206841928019476491> police at

Controversial drawing
Does this prove the power structure between the straw hats?!?
Not even gonna lie tho Zoro jaw and teeth probably stronger than most humans on our earth
Yeah he just flexes
<:ZoroHUH:701663617229127751>
Why do people think that zoro's scared eye will be relevant
Why do people think overused anime troupes translate to one piece
Yeah I agree
We know a few things about BB
One is that he's going for as many devil fruits as possible
Who is the person literally mass producing devil fruits?
The person that now finds themselves in the middle of a war
Perfect BB opportunity just like marineford
I just thought of something
Do smile fruits regrow after their user dies like normal ones do?
Lmao
Ight I'm back after watching Jinbei vs Moria
Jinbei did 2 shot him and while I won't deny that win at all Moria did underestimate him
Jinbei probably my fave strawhat now tbh
Yeah I like that Oda pointed out that he's more mature than most of the crew and stuff
Sawyer only appears when a war happens
Pre time skip vice admiral level
Actually tho
Do you think all the vice admirals had haki before the time skip?
Yeah ik all of them need to have haki but idk if that was always true or if that's something that war mongering Akainu changed when he became the leader
Yeah it would be cool if Dragon wasn't super strong
What
<@683663101186277416>  Me too but I'm just gonna say Oda said it
Brook so fucking op in WCI
Sanjitards on instagram say Sanji fought Oven so he's the second strongest on the crew but then Brook also fought him 👀
LMAO Vegito
> Why would people say Sanji is the second strongest because he fought Oven <@283276421470748673>  Because they compare it to Zoro fighting Killer
"Zoro got knocked out bro he can't even fight someone like killer"
Also I have a genuine question
Brooks cold powers are from his devil fruit right?
I mean I love both but Sanji being overly sexual makes me like zoro more
A bunch of people told me Brooks powers aren't from his devil fruit
Amd I genuinely thought it was
His cold powers
All his ice related stuff
I thought it was pretty obvious it was because he says things like the cold of hell and stuff
I mean Killer and Zoro are literally the only 2 supernova none captains for a reason
Luffy and Kid have the same dream
!powerscaling
Why doesn't that exist
Thank you
Wow I'm asking the same question
Oda draws obvious lines, "nah bro straw hats legit strongest crew in universe"
Sanji fought kizaru in opening? Sanji yonko level  🥵
Exactly
Yes
Nami > Zoro
Lmao that's true tho
I mean what's the 2nd most recent one it has online
That shit kinda fire tbh I used to play rank as Marco and merk everyone
Wtf
Jinbei Vs Zoro & Sanji
<@683663101186277416> I genuinely hope everyone is memeing but ik everyone isn't
Tbh honest tho in a world where people with powers have the weakness of water, someone who can control start kinda sick bro
> I know what will solve all our issues. **I'LL** beat Kaido <@274366418223497217>  Thanks Zeph 😔🙏
What did I miss of importance
Any super cool powers scaling conclusions made?
> <@!521783526878609418> Chouchou<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<Akainu <@415999229564157955>  Lmao huh u got the symbol backwards
Chouchou > Roger
Proof?
Chouchou protected his owners store, Roger didn't
When you give me Manga evidence of Roger protecting his dead owners store then we'll talk
Till then Chouchou
Aight fun question cause idk what's happening
1 devil fruit go
In real life
Not one piece world
For me it's the Phoenix fruit
No one has haki in real life
So I mean no death
You can fly
And you have tallens
Amd you have fire
What model lmao
Buddha?
Or just normal
👀
Ope ope is my second pic
Lmao you become more enlightened
Nah yo pp increases in size
The pewdiepie pewdiepie no mi
Well yeah homie law served his purpose

Yeah even if you don't train with marcos fruit like bruh healing fire
Yeah for the real world
Zoro fans coming with the nothing happened
I'm Zoro fans
There's a lot tbh that's tuff
Easier to do per character and even then it's not easy
Per arc even gets hard when you have 2 year long arcs lmao
BB is either gonna turn out to be a super amazing character with huge depth or Oda will just go nah he just bad guy
!hack
Pudding better come back tbh
I really thought she'd be integral to Sanji overall character but instead he's off looking for prostitutes
No
Spoiler chat
Yeah
It's a ruff death too
Nothing painless
Yeah same
Yes bro Kaido moon
<:ZoroNut:632474447462400010>
LMAO chapter 1 type vibes
He said he had a few helpers that draw that background and non important stuff
I read the sbs he said that in when it came out lmao
He has to release a chapter a week I'm happy he has help il
Imagine he didn't have help at all? We'd have even more breaks
Most?
Ever heard of luffy

Literary google it
I read an article about mangacas and how hard they work and Oda having helpers was a key part in it
The article I read doesn't state a source for it so that's not useful at all lmao
Tbh the classic Shonen: X ability improves power but will shorten their life span
It comes down to do we think oda will be like every other shonen mangaca and ignore it
Or actually stay true to the words of the manga
The hormones said that tho
I mean it's up to interpretation for sure and while I love oda, I think this is one of the few times he used a shonen troupe which isn't bad just not normal for him
Yeah at the point it doesn't affect the story at all
It isn't really a theory
It's more of a interpretation of what the manga says
And yeah the hormone thing literally said it
But I don't think it'll affect the story
One piece deserves spin offs just not in the future
Oda writing stories of Garp and Dragon
He said he wanted to do it
Let Oda do it
Nah I think Jinbei has been so close to death so many times that it's too obvious
Why should X die? Well because he's gonna die!
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
<@742532068608704532> sorry buddy but uh
Bad opinion
Yes as I am with every death
I didn't go Pedro? Ha knew it what a death vive character
Why
He has deep bond with Luffy
Y'all racist against Fishman
Lmao idk
He's had like a quarter of the arcs in one piece
You should've got used to him in marine ford lmao
Yeah it's almost like he has a life besides the crew which makes him seem more like a real person
More than... Carrot 👀
Bro if u feel that way about Jinbei but then tell me carrot should join
I'll leave this server I swear
What
WHAT
HUH?
<:WBeardWhat:638862189771620372>
Oh I thought u said she has more of a chance than jenbei
Yeah uh icebreaker explain bro
!speedreader2
Bro jenbei who?
Never heard of em
What he was in marineford? What's that? Ooh that white beard ace thing? Yeah ig it was ight
Have you seen WCI tho? 👀
Lmao
Barely saving someone isn't killing them
Wtf
Like he's been such an integral character to Luffy becoming more mature
Who snapped Luffy out of it when he was being a lil bitch boy?
Jinbei
<:JinbeiThug:695550217272950814>
I think Jinbei is a better character because he hasn't been with the crew
Imagine you have a whole life and huge amounts of responsibility for an entire RACE of people, you can't be selfish and just go ight I'm leaving to join luffy idc what happens good look
I'm still not sure why you don't like him tho
Not you like icebreaker

Look at that face
How's that not fun
He's laughing and having a great time
Fleebles bring in the Jinbei love too
> I just find him boring. He decides for the crew. He just doesn’t fit imo. <@742532068608704532>  Wdym he decides for the crew?
<@474659436804177930> Nah Icebreaker is completely against Jenbei while Bigbluepokes slightly against him
Huh?
You know Luffys rival Capone LMAO
No general statements with no reasoning behind them been put out by u but that's still better than Icebreaker saying stuff that doesn't make sense
What does that mean tho
Homes none your points made sense you said he almost killed luffy because he didn't save him enough <:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
Bro Nurses? They kill people constantly wtf
Cap
The biggest cap
Him and luffy literally love each other
Jinbei has better chemistry with people than most of the crew now
You mean when all the women hated him
And half the crew was scared of him
Huh?
You read Robin and Jinbei
I have no problem with people having an argument but like say a reason behind your points
That's how a debate works
Facts fats
Can we get a !fats where it just says facts
Idk what makes him boring tbh
Y'all see that joke zoro made? LMAO
I think it's literally the fact that he's been gone so long
But also I love that
Zoro smiled
This argument is over Zoro smiled
If Zoro smiled to a nakama joining like that
It means something
Bad chemistry, oda literally writes "what a moral boost"
Literally had the responsibility of an entire SPECIES of people on his shoulders
Out of the crew Jinbei probably one of THE most important people
The Knight of the Sea
> in terms of what? <@372464153480134666>  Is this @ me?
Because the responsibility of the protection of the fishmen species has been on his shoulders for decades
Oh yeah I meant like compared to the other people on it
Not on the crew itself, I meant on the crew as compared to the others
Like if Nami died an entire species of people wouldn't go bruh
Icebreaker you're so cool for blindly hating someone without any actual reasoning 😔
We got a super cool troll boys
Everyone praise him
There's a difference between not getting someone and saying him dying would be your favorite arc 💀
Can we just some Yamato love in the chat
Where the yamato emojis at 😔

Yes
This meme proves it
I don't tbh that's a lil too op
Making plot armor to a real thing
If Law was close to momo he would give it to him
But Law isn't really close to anyone but Luffy and his crew
I can't think of anyone he'd perform the surgery on besides Luffy or his crew
But that probably wouldn't happen
Nah if someone he really cares about is about to die I'd see him doing it
<#206841928019476491>
Go there icebreaker
I'm not a channel nazi tho don't get me wrong but if people are in da middle of a convo about one-piece they're probably not gonna switch to my hero
I don't like channel nazis but for the sake of people replying your best bet is there
Well everyone was just talking about luffys life being shortened by the hormones
Maybe that would cancel the affects
I don't think it'll happen but that's the best reason I can think of tbh
Same
Yeah like I said earlier it's one of the few times Oda used a Shonen troupe
And did nothing different with it
Power levels was one of those times but he made it unique
Enies loby was an arc of shonen troupes lmao
Nah a fighting tournament isn't really a troupe and more of a thing that's just a martial arts thing, and it wasn't even a normal japanese martial arts tourny it was a colloseom gladiator thing
So even then he still did it fairly differently
Oh I'm not saying troupes are bad and people shit on them too much
But Oda usually doesn't use them is all
Lmao
Ok
Yeah there was also a lot of stuff happening in the country at large
The tournament arc also wasn't: main character strong so main character fight
It was that's my dead brothers will
It wasn't bad writing it's just a common troupe of saying a strong technique hurts your body by using t because it was so strong and they can't handle the power
That's just how manga is
Well I mean we know at least the gear third problems were fixed
At the end of the day it was never stated that gears shorten his life span
It was stated they have a toll on his body
Ive been in a lot of car accidents, that has taken a heavy toll on my body but that doesn't necessarily mean my life is shorter than if I didn't have the accident
Yeah the complete control of instant gear 2 and use of it so perfectly is also a good reason to assume that he doesn't has a toll on his body anymore
It also was never stated about life span tho
Lucci said its a toll on his body
Did he? I'm pretty sure he just said toll
Ik the hormones for sure mentioned it
IDK if we on the same topic
But
At least this translation stated only Luffy was "hacking away at his life"

Not that he was shortening his life span
I think Oda left this vague on purpose
But also this is one translation
And again it's up for interpretation
I love Tekking
But that doesn't make him Oda
Tekking is a genuinely good person and one of my favorite YouTubers
But he has made videos that were proven wrong multiple times
He isn't a god just a good guy
So again let us not just take his words as fact I haven't watched that Lifespan vid since it came out so idek what he says but either way let's not just take that as canon
Nah I think he's an actual compassionate guy that loves people
Lmao
Remember that time Oda made Shanks lose his arm chapter 1
There's literally a ton of different reasons tbh
If we're going with actual science
Literally a different gravity could cause extended life span from what Nasa has seen
Well that's different that's from the quality of life increasing
That doesn't happen in the one piece world
Bruh we back to this
I still say it could be more than 1 or 1
It doesn't have the perfect evidence
But until someone says there's 1 moon
Then ig we don't know for sure
Ohara mostly
Yeah but again there's planets in the real world with multiple moons but you can only see one at a time
The Oharans thought so
I'm no a provacater for this theory
I'm just saying either way we can not be 100%
It does already
Ok now a common disregard to this is the geocentric argument
Which I disagree with 110%
I personally think there's 1 moon
But thinking that the literal smartest and most study people in the world were geocentric when they have very advanced tech is dumb
Moons can have moons too
Moon moons are not impossible
This is also a world void of logic
> there is no way to see that the earth goes around the sun from earth <@202087725833125889>  Yes there is, by this logic we would be geocentric until we had satellites in space lmao
That's the geocentric thing I was talking about,
With the basic technologies of the one piece world they should know the earth isn't the center of the universe
Yes with your eyes but using basic technology and looking at how things in the sky work you can tell we aren't the center
In real life people knew we weren't the center over a century before the pirate age
Yeah but we figured it out with technology that the oharans have
I'm not saying there's multiple moons
But I am saying the Oharans are dumb enough to think that Earth is the center of the universe
> It's a one-off drawing to fit the theme of Oharans being scholars, and that's literally it <@186562609254891520>  I agree 100%
But saying the Oharans are geocentric kinda makes no sense when looking at technology and science but also it's the one piece world
Like if this was a random island than yeah the geocentric theory makes a lot of sense
But this is Ohara, the people known across the world for being smart
> <@!521783526878609418> maybe they're studying how the ancient people thought about space. Lack of imagination from your part <@415999229564157955>  No someone actually said this yesterday and it's my head canon and what I'm going with tbh
That makes the most sense to me
Yeah but that's like specific places
I'm talking about the knowledge available to the widest amount of places that the Oharans who travel the world would know
Like the basic stuff
That's why if they were just an island of scientist and not famous and world travelers the geocentric would work
Also not to suck off Oda but he does do things sometimes that fit with the real life pirate era
My head canon is that they're studying what people of the past thought
Because these just aren't people in 1 place
Yeah fats thats why I'm just going with like what the basic citizens have because I'm not gonna pretend like Oharans were vegapunk level lmao
Like Oharans traveled that's a big part of it for me
But also multiple moons is kinda dumb and even if there was the excuses needed to make go explain it would make it irrelevant to the story in the first place
I think there's 1 moon
But I also don't think Oharans are geocentric lmao
Yeah but 500 years ahead of what?
Any island not affiliated with the world gov has a different level of tech
> <@!521783526878609418> Little Garden <@415999229564157955>  Exactly lmao
World gov controlled islands from what we see all have like the same basic levels of basic late pirate era tech
Some have more or less but that can be chalked up to the amount of money on the island
Any non affiliated island
Literary could have anything
Not in normal marine controlled islands
The marines themselves yeah cause of vegapunk
But Wow the more tech you give them the more it proves they aren't geocentric hehehe
Go ahead Germa confuses me too a lot
The germa comic didn't exist before Sanji was born right?
They based it off of the kids right?
So maybe out of respect of their "dead son" they made stealth black a character
I see but things like communication exist because of a natural thing that isn't on earth, and anything involving Vega punk I won't dispute because I think the Government purposely doesn't let the world have his tech and same with aviation
Our earth I should say
We don't have snail boys
But when it comes to things like houses, farming, boats, weapons, and the main things that every day citizens of the world government see are all relatively the same era of technology
> But then thats headcanon Alex because avaiation would extremely beneficial for the military to have. Also the snails have been showed to be hacked and tampered and also changed to fit the designs of characters. They clearly have some advancements in hacking or tampering with comminication which is something that took us a lonnnggg while to get to<@521783526878609418> <@683663101186277416>  The aviation is headcanon you're right but assuming in our world if we also had the same communication snails as the one piece world we wouldn't have developed it much earlier is also just assumptions
We can't compare the sea snails because that's different from anything we have in our world tbh
The aviation thing is 100% my head canon tho
Also sorry I'm not keeping up with germa thing
Are the germa comics older than the germa siblings?
Wow the both of us are also trying to compare our two worlds when in their world bodies work differently
I mean the Oharans don't have a reason to do anything
They do the knowledge just for that knowledge
I mean besides navigation unless imu wanted to go to space nothing
But navigation is super connected to astronomy especially during the pirates era
But you also don't need a super good understanding of astronomy for that
Yeah exactly you don't needa know slot lol
To navigate
Still is tbh
To get a boating license and be a professional boating captain for most things you need a basic understanding of astronomy even today just in case your equipment fails
It's not that big a deal because your equipment mostly won't fail
But you still supposed to be able to know the basic stuffs
You actually can't sail unless you know about astrology and your sign and what other signs you're compatible with 🥵
Libra tehehehe
Do compasses exist in one piece?
Yeah probably in the ,4 blues
> <@521783526878609418> yes in the normal seas <@289876647354826752>  Yeah that's what I thought
> <@521783526878609418> you deadass? <@237434464656031744>  I mean logposes aren't normal compasses
Wait I'm dumb
Nami had one
And it didn't work
In the grandline
I remember the scene now lmao
Look its late here I'm half asleep
Friendship
Because
!hack
The one piece is gonna where I finally find people to do a one piece dnd campaign with 😔
I mean racism
They different
So we better
It's a common mentality in uneducated people
> how come no fishmen marines??? <@268569943723868161>  That's actually a good question
You think more would join to try to smooth relations
I mean Jinbei literally joined the warlords basically part of the marines to try to smooth things out
There's racism against all non human races
There's still giant marines
> fishmen were kept as slaves by the saints, they fucking **hate** humans <@244273354222075915>  Yeah until that lady went ham and moved the people's hearts
> They would not allow a fishmen to join the marines <@237434464656031744>  I would agree if the fishmen weren't just eat stronger
It's the same reason there's giants
Even if they're seen as less than humans by the humans they're still an asset
Debatable
I think it's because they don't want to
Not as much that the marines wouldn't use them
The marines even use priates
G5
> what do you guys think hawkins will do in wano? <@736969911573676082>  Can't do anything if they aren't there
Nvm
I thought that said mihawk
Again it's late at night here my bad
Lmao
I read mihawk and thought bruh
Hawkins loyal to his cards
And that's it
Not confirmed
But we think
Damn idk if y'all picked it up
But moria told jinbei when he tried taking his shadow that after he took it then he'd really be stuck at the bottom of the sea with the rest of those fishmen where the sun can't reach
Makes me hate Moria even more now after everything we learned
Moria a bad guy
Just a stinky person
Ugly
Dumby head
<:ZoroWeary:701983967041159169>
Bruh he actually gave it to Roger
Nah jk Moria gave his hat to Joy Boy
Y'all remember Joy Boy
Yeah me neither
Before 10 chapters ago
Not in my memory
Bruh
Maybe he was half giant half fishman
That'd be epic
To get it on with Oden
<@244273354222075915> Wotan from Davie back
Means never heard of it lmao
Marco should be fighting king rn instead of licking lollipop man grrrrr
Marco comes back after years, stands on beach and talks
My mom at the supermarket when she sees her friend
Me and the other ladies son
Man king is cool
Hes a new race
He's edgy
What more do u need?
He has a KATANA
I wonder how many are dead
