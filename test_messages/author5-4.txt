Is the law novel illustrated or not
Yeah
I wanna see vid valley movie
> <@564773067969265674> what <@606196171307745308>  yeah the manga is 60 chapters or smth and the anime is 170 episodes
> <@564773067969265674> its just sad how good the manga is and how shit the anime <@606196171307745308>  the manga is okay but the anime turned into slice of life which I can understand but it’s a big change
Vegito with the facts
I’ll read the page gimme a sec
It’s just talking about the history of the treasure and how garp defeated jao and broke his heart so he left the empire
And how garp was considered the hero of the marines
I goofed up big time in 987 tho
I mistook あれfor おれbc the font was not clear. So I basically translated they as we
My pleasure guys
The title they choose was not what the Japanese said but they probably have their reasons
In Japan it’s Sunday too unless there’s a holiday
But we get raws on Thursday and clean scans and Friday
Shop owners or delivery drivers snatch a copy and leak the chapter
You need connections with someone in Japan to get leaks tho
It’s not illegal rather shady according to artur
The leaks have to come from Japan but the one who posts them can be Korean
^
Are you calling zeph dumb stoopid
Damn
I find it weird that some youtubers released reviews last week even before the French scans were out
Bda law and joyboy
Bda is decent
Yeah he’s really into levels
Glr is my go to rn
Joyboy thought the traitor was the sheep in zou lmao
Bda law and glr had a debate about power scaling. It was good
There was no winner vegito. Both had good points
Show us your meditation stoopid
There was no beef lmao
Every YouTuber has their big oof moments
Some more than others
Are Ohara’s reviews good. I heard he reviews the Japanese now
No
It’s not a big deal
Yea me too coded
Roger base had a video with girls in nami and robin cosplay. Too much skin, it was creepy
No I mean the atmosphere of the video not the cosplay lmao
Tekking is chill I love him
Tekking is like your friend who loves op
I love tekking’s streams he’s very chill there
I don’t feel that way about him zeph
He just seems like a 14 yo op mega fan
Bda law sketches are cringy af
What I love about tekking is that he doesn’t stay on topic
Tekking ranking boobs was amazing
> oh , that skit guy <@328936254978916352>  bda does skits now
They cringy af bro
Yeah I’ll give him that
Btw who watches those text youtubers ? Like wtf and it’s all shit theories anyway
Why would I watch a video of text tho
What do you guys think of nux
Mix is amazing on the podcast but his vids are trash
The op virgin is the only thing I follow rn
Watch the op virgin bean you’ll love it
Does artur live in Japan ?
Artur is German iirc
Briggs loves op but his vida aren’t great imo
Damn there’s a lot of op YouTubers
Post marineford is a lot in its own
Yeah mark was with nux in the podcast yesterday zeph
Nux is really chill in the podcast
Nux is a mega fan of op but he’s weird too weird
Anime uproar have decent op reviews
Yeah I know
Is gozen not like animak
Who watches the anime man ? He is decent imo
Anime man is all over the place
There’s an anime pachinko wtf
Op and HxH are the best mangas I’ve read
Exactly kamui
Yeah I loved the endings
The VAs are all top tier in op
The guests arriving at wholcake chateau was way better in the anime with the music
Animation in wano has been generally better but the pacing tho
Remember luffy vs urashima
Queen OST is fire
> <@!703504844903940096> I went to my local book store and read thriller bark @Kamui.#3859  I first saw the Arabic dub and the opening was them saying one piece over and over lmao
Batman is yonkou level
What lazy
Kata and queen music are the best recent stuff
Overtaken us the shit
Judging by queen then king should have a good ost
I’m too focused on the action so I don’t notice the music
What is that pos
Who wrote it
Bye coded
Is that from op joker
I think it’s an old symphony
What arc
> ohbutwhydontthemarineskilltheemperorstholul <@!114296407816404992>  wtf bean
Ok I’m too dumb
But they were the victors
If The marines are going after the yonkou then that’s a bold move
So we know how Bonney escaped the marines after bb captured her
Why would garp help her
Oh yeah
She was chained with sea prism right ?
I want to see more Bonney she seems really interesting
Wtf is happening lmao
Bonney, Kidd and drake are the only supernova who seem interesting rn
The rest are meh
Why would I care about uroge
Law is a given lol
Drake is really interesting rn bc ssg and kaido and the war
That’s how you know he’s gonna be good
We don’t know
I wanna see if drake will take the side of the sh
Break bro
Kaido doesn’t need intelligence groups to know what the marines think. The abolished the warlords and it was in the newspapers
^
It’s obvious tho. The marines won’t abolish a force that keeps the balance without having some thing else
What would caribou benefit from telling bm that
Caribou is an idiot so I can see him doing it ngl
Yeah he should be able to
Lmao
Do you think kanjuro told orochi or kaido about the road poneglyph in zou
Kanjuro is an weird place. He’s obviously a traitor but he’s not doing his best for orochi either
He’s not loyal but I’d say confused
True
Kanjuro is becoming more interesting
They went to dresseosa bc of the call they got
It’s basically whatever luffy wants to do
Roger laughed bc they were too early
Roger thought he had to be quicker but he was 25 years early lol
They learned both the history and the “ prophecy”
Why
I see your point, but I trust oda
plot cage ?
Elaborate more mochi
Fujitora was the only one who could stop doffy by going after him but he trusted luffy so I do t see the problem
> NGL I think oda gave some major plot armor to doffy with the bird cage. It conveniently put some of the strongest fighters in dressrosa at the time to defending against it, so that luffy could fight doffy without zoro or others coming to his help. <@!182986298687094785>  the crew doesn’t interfere with luffy’s fights anyway so...
> <@564773067969265674> the grand fleet at the time weren't part of the crew and all Hated doff. It gave them a convenient excuse to keep them away from the fight. <@!182986298687094785>  other than luffy sabo and Fuji who do you think could’ve defeated doffy ?
Inherited haki doesn’t mean that they literally inherited from Oden but they learned how to use it bc there his retainers
> <@564773067969265674> solo? I don't think anyone other than those 3. But put up a decent fight against him? Most of the grand fleet captains can use haki and are pretty strong. There were 5-10 people in dressrosa that if they weren't blocked by birdcage could've helped luffy fight doflamingo. <@!182986298687094785>  just bc they use haki and can gang up on doffy doesn’t mean they’ll win. Law and luffy teamed up and didn’t beat him. It took gear4 luffy two times to win
^
^
Rayleigh removing the collar from camie was adv armament right ? Just like luffy removing Yamato’s cuffs. So adv armament dies damage from the inside that’s how luffy and the scabbards can hurt kaido
If the scabbards use the lower form now can they pierce kaido ? Shouldn’t he be sent flying then ?
> wasn't it rokuougan? <@184025649646665728>  lucci just says it epically rokuuuuugan
> Scabbards didn't do that though <@!372464153480134666>  if they used what sentumaru used then kaido should’ve been blown away not pierced
Bc it’s a shockwave more than damage
I see your point laww but I’m not convinced
If it’s the same as hyou then kaido wouldn’t have been pierced rather just damaged from the haki coating the sword
Right ?
Bc the haki coating the sword would’ve damaged him from the inside rather than the outside
Again I understand what you’re saying but I disagree
Okay
If they used a mace
What would happen then
A mace is blunt just like the hand right. Then how would it pierce
Okay, Yamato’s weapon. What would it do
Okay laww so what luffy did to the tree is diff from what hyou did. Is that what you’re saying
I get it now. The panel juba posted explained it. The outcome of applying adv haki to a sword is diff than a fist
I was confused over the two applications of adv haki
> What did Katakuri's mold itself as? It could bypass Luffy's normal Armament like the form of it that seeps into an object, but it doesnt exactly destroy Luffy internally. <@!274366418223497217>  I think his armament was just stronger
Yeah zeph
It was harder
Was Fuji using normal observation ? It was just like ussop did. Or is it a higher level
Kata still dodged some attacks tho
Kata was amazing
I think she could sense people’s emotion
Shyarly just had a weird ability right
Shyraly just scans people
Not luffy
A man wearing a straw hat
Small brain cookie
I think laboon would be last
As the end of the journey
Foxy was really fun
Has anyone seen the luffy oyabun filler
It was amazing
Foxy comes back too
Really
I love how he says aho baka which both mean idiot lol
I need to rewatch that filler
It’s hilarious lmao
Robin feeding luffy in punk hazard was adorable
We need more sh interactions and comedy man
Marimo baka
Santoryu
Nitoryu
Yeah I goofed
<:Crydo:586275183032270849>
The French scans make kaido’s laugh wolololo
<:TamaHuh:735289165109002260>
Hey where can I read the colored chapters
Is it the zolo translation
Damn that was hilarious
Tobi roppo in the audience lmao
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
But really tho. If he was too early who’s didn’t he just jump forward in time
This was born here
The best server on the world
nah Just give up
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
Growing up without a father or someone who’s distant can cause issues
Not the conventional ” daddy issues” tho
How did germa make sanjis bounty alive only ? Did they pay morgans or was it bm’s connections
What’s confusing about the bounties is that akainu was surprised by luffy’s 1.5bil so who set it then
Sengoku told garp that if he wasn’t the hero of the marines then He woulda been held responsible for the actions of his family
That just goes to show how much of a threat rocks was
> wierd how Rocks was this huge threat, and yet he's been almost entirely erased from history <@491390898031296532>  that makes perfect sense actually
The marines might try to cut off the connection between their hero and dragon so the won’t tell people
The admirals must know but marine fodder def won’t
That was a gag
Marine fodder are totally useless
Yeah you can use fodder to flex coc
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
Sanji on the other hand
So an army of chickens isn’t chickens
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
I laughed too hard at that cookie thx bro
Are trying to say that trebol was a bad villain zeph
Mr5 is gladues lite
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
No
Long range
Ofc not chicken
Who’s that loser getting no diffed ichiji
You should not argue with Instagram people
What’s happening to joy boy ? He lost his hair completely
Not hair lol shit
His thumbnail art is good I’ll give him that
It’s not his art lol
He pays an artist
His reviews are decent but his theories...<:WBDisgust:650047749831524372>
He thought the traitor was the sheep from zou <:TamaHuh:735289165109002260> wtf
Nah the big sheep nami slept on
His reasoning was the was ... after his speech and ida never uses ... unless there’s smth
<:TamaHuh:735289165109002260>
Chill fleeb
Bege let’s his infant son smoke a cigar. Best dad ever
Cigar bro get cultured
Fleeb I knew your points were useless but that’s too much
In the manga I think it’s a real cigar
Still funny either way
Yeah my bad then
How did bm go from bad to good to bad agian
Even her face changes lol
Oof
Did they color luffy vs kata
That would be dope
Probably mean mother
How old is pero
And bm
Close one
His father was the cook yeah
That dude is creepy
Did bm have peros with her in rocks as a crew member
Yeah but I’m wondering if peros was part of the crew too
Everyday we start further away from god
I think a a admiral could hold his own but a yonkou would win
Powerscaling here is smth else lmao
Caribou has a crescent moon in his beard. Caribou kouzuki confirmed
We haven’t seen ussop use haki since dressrosa so we don’t know
Ussop used observation just like Fuji
> Thats litterally what observation is <@434140622488862720>  I mean Fuji and ussop are the only one who can see silhouettes right ?
Yeah it could be
The official digital version isn’t the best quality for some reason wtf
How many times did you change your name today stoopid
Shot ofc
Red hair vivi would like bad
Would kiku look good with red hair
<a:usoppno:470029376348487701>
Op art is so good
Geeeee
>chambers
That scene with wb and the giant was so good in the anime
No new stuff
<:BoaGasm:701744981811134515>
> but doing a single chapter took like 4 hours <@272064319661801473>  <:TamaHuh:735289165109002260>
What are doing that take a4 hours
Oh you redraw, that takes a lot yeah
Really good work. How long does typesetting take you
How about me fleeb. I’m new so there’s no way I’m on the list right
Mistakes like what
It takes some getting used to. Do you work on a pc
Stoop is newkama so no sruprise there
Stoop stop playing with us
Things are getting too weird
I’m scared
ReReread
Big time
It’s actually terrifying how fast the pace is
Orochi deserves to die that way ngl
Monet sacrificed herself for doffy’s sake. What cold heart
How’s the quality of the pages oj
> got myself the first edition volume and shonen mag from japan last year <@598085666538258432>  how’s the quality of the pages ? Is the print clear
How much was the volume
Don’t provoke me stoopid
I ordered 95 and 96 from Japan but was not sure about the quality
Since they’re only 440 yen
> I'm being honest <@!415999229564157955>  it’s nice to see acceptance of bird people
Why her and not Rebecca
<a:usoppno:470029376348487701>
Is kata mochi all the time like luffy is always rubber
So if you touch luffy he’s always rubber and can stretch then if I pull on kata do I get mochi
So that’s the only diff between logias and special paramicias
I just want to be clear
Bc if you touch akainu you won’t burn right
She has to maintain her beauty
Well mochi is rice so..
Why did oda go that route with it
Just call it a logia
<a:salt:469186979553083392>
How so
Bless me with your knowledge master
After all that time I’d you typing I was expecting more ngl
I gotta say
I’m disappointed stoopid
^

I’m a med student too. Doesn’t mean shit stoopid
Let me make it clear stoopid
If it were to come to a flexing match
You have no chance
See stoopid
You failed the test
Real strong people don’t flex
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
Pathetic
I listed 0 viruses
> Monet was the main character until she died <@!274366418223497217>  her death only made her more amazing
Nah stoopid
0 bc I have no need to prove anything
See stoopid
My goals are beyond your comprehension
If you stop I’ll let you go this time
You lose either way stoopid
You’ve already lost
You’re just too dumb to realize it
What if I’m you
Hesitation...
An obvious sign of weakness
See stoopid
See that
That’s 0.0000000001 of my power
I forgive u fats
<:KataLUL:562005179571109888>
How old is this server btw
Oof
<:akainuban:608389100583780353>
No You won’t fleeb
That’s early fats
I started watching in 2007
Hey <@!415999229564157955> I hope I didn’t go too far with the big brain jokes. It’s all in good fun buddy
What’s wrong with the Japanese fate
Stoopid, I have no time for tomfoolery
Lol fate
> Japanese volumes are interesting. I got one of a recent one since I went to Japan <@!274366418223497217>  what do you mean interesting ? Are they good or not
I will play with you more some other time stoopid
Volumes are like 5 $ stoopid
Stop stealing
That’s the one I ordered zeph. Now I’m more excited
You have money <:TamaHuh:735289165109002260>
True
Rice is a staple almost everywhere
20 cent ramen too
Am I the only one who likes plain pasta
Plain pasta is the best bro
In the pasta
Stoopid understands
I hate Parmesan
> Pasta, salt and maybe some oil and I'm good <@!415999229564157955>  exactly, and then I drink the water with all the pasta and sauce essence
Damn stoopid, you’re not so stoopid anymore
Yes stoopid
Stale bread too
Either is good
This server is woke
<:FujiWoke:638345772953370624>
Ok I have the real question
Ketchup on the fries or on the side
Wrong
The answer is Mayo
Do you make pickles at home  too stoopid
^
Homemade pickles are the best
> All pickeled food is disgusting <@471505711529197569>  I mean your name IS satan
Eat bee ass secretion
Real honey or super market honey, pasta ?
Strong roots
What other animal secretion do humans eat
Spider silk ?
Anyone
Yeah
I do
Anyone heard of the forbidden kiwi
In Japan they eat octopus mouth and live shrimp. Wtf
Who said it’s a corpse
Yeah so one piece
<a:NamiRunning:585643147086921737>
I’ll be stealing that, thank you

I need to get a kiku wall scroll


Don’t we all

Get outta here


Op is amazing
^
Kiku can love you and protect you
Yeah
She’s badass
I’d like to know too root
How about monet
Zoro doesn’t care for love and women
He loves swords and booze
Zoro is beyond peasantly human urges and desires
We can get development without him dying
If his death has purpose then it can develop his character yeah, but, it’s not necessary
Oh sorry wow
> Nothing's Necessary it's a manga <@521783526878609418>  yeah but we judge what’s likely by looking at the story and how things can happen and develop without being an ass pull
What was bb going after in 956
Why would he go after warlords
He says that if the wg isn’t gonna claim it then he will
What is it though
I don’t see how abolishing the warlords can open up a chance for bb to get a poneglyph
True
Kata is a beast tho
Would be a nice fight
It makes sense yeah
I don’t think bb wants to blackmail the wg with doffy or the info he holds
Doffy is losing his shit down there
Yeah but he’s losing it even more lmao
A lot
Kidd luffy kaido bm
Who else
Did bb explicitly say he wants to be pk
Shanks shoulda moved on bb along time ago
Bb is getting more powerful by the day and it will be too much even for shanks
Is weevil really that strong
Kizaru seems to be exaggerating
He can’t be as strong as young wb
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
He did beat 16 wb captains tho
Gravity won’t stop light in op
> nah kizaru beats all of them cuz he my favorite <@!212265078739828737>  powerscaler logic lmao
Can kizaru add haki to his light projectiles
Wb didn’t kill akainu how can garp do it
Science is fun but it doesn’t work in op
Garp had a duty as a marine
They all die
Yeah but garp gets enough shit for the actions of his family already. Imagine what would happen if he saved ace
If Fuji can create a black hole then he automatically wins
> <@631190162566676480>  > Taking Ace as his grandson doesn't do against his entire lifes career <@521783526878609418>  he still left him to dadan to stay away from being connected to him in the eye of the public
So garp took his precautions
How
Barto can’t close it on himself completely
We saw it in dressrosa
There’s an area limit but maybe not strength in barto’s power
He can still be pushed tho
His barrier isn’t immovable too
^
Zeph is too woke for this pleb chat
Barto’s barrier deflects everything so probably kizaru’s attacks too
The energy from kizaru’s attack would probably heat up barto’s barrier but not penetrate it
If you want to apply real life science
Purple
How white ?
How can we have white fire tho
Hot boi
Microwave
If wapol eats bb does he get 3 df
Wapol eats himself
Can wapol eat a poneglyph
Just like buggy swallowing a pineapple
Buggy’s fruit is dope
He can fly and avoid cuts
Also has infinite lifting power when flying
If law cuts buggy in his room can buggy reattach
Buggy has to be cut with haki, nothing else works
Buggy gets pulled towards his feet
We see it in impel down
Zeph my brain too small, it hurts <:ViviPanic:738523407808856145>
They have their will but they’re linked to her
So if she does they die too
Vp can already feed objects df
Zeph bouta spit some facts
Yeah I get your point
Since they’re sentient they be better fighters
Zeph you should be an oda editor
He needs your knowledge
> metal metal fruit would be another natural counter to eneru and could possibly redirect his attacks <@598085666538258432>  or it would absorb all the damage lmao
^
Are you a science major zeph
Bc you like it or for op
I was kidding oj
It’s cool
I’ve been here for 18 hours today
Insomnia go brrrrrr
Hey there strong
People can survive lightning tho
It’s nothing to be upset about. Op is a shonen not a science manga
I’ve seen photos of people struck. By lightning who survived. It’s gnarly
Twice to croco boi
Lucci
Maybe your brain will charge fleeb
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
That’s part of why he’s a great protagonist
Everything is possible
Anime is there to make shot cool not to focus on the canon stuff bahamas. It’s made for the manga fans
Everyone in Japan reads the manga and the anime is made for them
Toei didn’t make money from western audience
Skypia was like a mini adventure outside the world. It was so fun
It introduced a nice culture and a nice history
Skypia I mean
Zou was build up for wano mostly
Yeah I know lol
<a:usoppno:470029376348487701>
All the op arcs are very dense in events and info except lrll maybe
We learned about the raid poneglyphs in zou, we met raizo, we met the monks, we saw jack and we learned the connection of the monks to the kouzuki
Zou was amazing
Damn you got me there
> Kinda impressive how laboon allowed crocus to just casually go inside him and build shit <@473457586234982410>  crocus had him on drugs bro
That’s a seal ? Thought it was a dirty rag ngl
Raizo has a big head
Big head = big brain
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
But seriously why do people give raizo shit
He’s amazing
Raizo played udon like a violin
Fuck caribu
Reverse imo card
I’ll give it you this time
Ignore them bobo they just hating bc they’re losers
Caribu is lit dirt and water bro
Raizo is a ninja
Raizo is beyond such peasantly desires
Oda gives females unique designed but their faces look so similar
> Caribou is better at espionage and staying undercover than raizo <@!289876647354826752>  that’s why he was captured and sent to udon to be a slave
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
Raizo held my hand at night when I had a nightmare and made me feel better
He’s a ninja so he shouldn’t have tremendous power
Ninjas are stealthy
> Ninjas also can't disappear or have giant faces <@!289876647354826752> why discriminate against people with giant faces
Not cool bahamas
Oof
I never really liked anime games
They feel repetitive after a while
Yeah I get it, wano has been amazing
Imagine an open world op rpg with all the islands and characters
What
I don’t like smash so I can’t relate
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
I heard that world seeker was shit. Is that true
Who cares lol
I’ll be stealing that alpha, ty
Break week is tough Bahamas
All op youtubers are def here under fake names most likely
Yeah but they would come here to check what people are saying about the chapters and such
Dude, now I have an image of a hairy bm in my head. Fuck
Thank you  pasta
Fleeb we all know you’ve been lurking
Lafeet looks dope Bahamas
I just want bepo sulong <:Crydo:586275183032270849>
> i wonder if the mark is a tattoo or a mark like the slave and sun pirates mark <@!198930928083402753>  do you mean bc it’s diff than the small crescent moon that the others have ? I think denjiro is so dedicated that he got the full symbol tattooed on him
<@!198930928083402753>  it would be cool, but denjiro was the 2nd to join oden so why would he be a slave
Oh my bad, I thought you meant he was a slave when you said “slave mark”.  But yeah that would be really badass
> also i think i broke my left ctrl <@!198930928083402753>  <:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
Use the right ctrl
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
I would love to play as Yamato
Who plays anything but the hardest diff Alex smh
Are the other characters paid
That’s just a scam.  How much for a character
How much is the game itself usually
Is the new one with wano characters on ps4 or 5
The changed ace to trace bc it was the name of some alcohol but they kept whiskey peak <:TamaHuh:735289165109002260>
Why would they skip skypia
The recent movies lack consequences for me. But gold was fun
Gold was hilarious and... sexy
Hand island was good for me
Yeah movie plots are not that great
Keep in mind that a movie is much shorter than the arcs of build up we get in op so it will certainly feel sub par in terms of plot. That’s why they have the best  animation
Film z was good in terms of plot
Ace’s alabasta face design was hilarious
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
Zoro doesn’t necessarily need to defeat mihawk to achieve his dream
It would be disappointing if he didn’t tho
We’ve been waiting for this for years
He could achieve some feat to get the title
Exactly
It’s been anticipated for decades basically
Just like kaido wants to die
They’re that strong
I was shocked to see mihawk train him
But it developed zoro as character
Maybe zoro dies
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
If zoro dies fighting mihawk it would be the dumbest thing ever
Interesting by infuriating
As I always say
Trust oda
Why would mihawk join bb when bb is shanks’ worst enemy
Bro mihawk left marineford when shanks arrived. He respects him
I can’t see mihawk jointing bb
Give me a valid reason vegito
That’s not valid
Why would mihawk help or join bb. Mihawk as a character has no reason to do that
Mihawk isn’t a coward
Even if bb could mihawk won’t join him
Marines can probably capture Rayleigh but they have more important stuff than a gambling old man
Yeah let’s leave powerscaling out of this convo please
There’s no reason for mihawk to join bb even if bb can defeat him or blackmail him somehow. Mihawk isn’t a coward and he probably doesn’t care if he dies
> Doubt 2 admirals can take mihawk <@96965684428283904>  bro you good <:TamaHuh:735289165109002260>
Sengoku didn’t fight jack iirc
But jack took down two of their four ships
People make jack look like he’s fodder. Give the man some credit
^
Jack fought for 5 days without sleep while his enemies slept and then he went after the marines and took down half of their ships. Dude is a monster
Did neko and inu fight jack in sulong ?
<@96965684428283904> he fought an admiral to take down the ships. And neko and inu couldn’t have been that much weaker thank jack. Especially combined
Exactly
If queen and king are stronger than jack then they will be amazing
^
I’m curious how luffy would compare to the scabbards rn
Did neko and inu use sulong against jack or not
Damn
Now I’m more excited for next chapter
^
It’s a joke
The fight with jack happened 2 weeks before the straw hats arrived. How long did it take from zou to wci ?
How long did the straw hats stay in wci
So it’s still kinda possible that neko and inu uaed sulong against jack. Bc the fight happened two weeks before the sh arrived and then they went to the wci which took about a week and stayed they’re for a few days until the fool moon
Unless neko and inu missed the full moon by a couple of days
If inu said that then I can’t argue with it
Yeah sulong neko and inu seem to be monsters lit
Neko and inu can do some damage to kaido then. Damn. Ofc they won’t beat him tho
Kaido will at some point
<@!274366418223497217>  what’s the problem there ? He had a whole day to think about his choices and he learned more info too
He will
<@!274366418223497217> it was a short time but a lot of shot happened. I’m okay with it
Zoro is such a bully ngl
Fair enough
Where do you find that shit vegito
Sup being friends with them
<a:usoppno:470029376348487701>
Is that Monet slander I hear
This is best girl

Don’t lie to yourselves
Oof
Is this your first watch through ziphy
How do you like it compared to the manga
Really
Are you watching the original or on one pace
I started with the anime but I find the manga more enjoyable
I still watch the anime bc it’s fun tho
The server is brutal today damn
He just does
His name is king the wild fire so it should have a reason
no Stop
> Also just got a new gif if anyone wants to cop <@532302418210193411>  I’ll be taking that, thank you very much
77
825-902
Does 902 count in
Oh yeah my bad
Yeah 902 is included
How long do you guys think wano will go
Yeah I’d give it another year
If it’s 5 acts
The 5th should be like post wano
Very short
He had no problem in romance dawn
Should be nothing
Amaeeing their families would be a good reason to go
You know what I mean
No need to make me sad
<:Crydo:586275183032270849>
Damn the theories that come outta this server are...
Buggy was born with his nose
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
Wow discrimination against red nose people I’m speechless
Fleeb not cool

Gee
> mugiwara no ichibi <@727466656116506744>  ichimi
The real question is how will momo’s dragon form get into play
I am surprised as to how many people ask about the break when it says right in the chapter
Are there any people here reading from day one
I doubt it
When did you guys start
Halter 1 was in 1997
I started in 2011
With the anime
Damn cookie
Op is ancient lmao
Oda spent all his life on op
Oda is doing a service for the world
We’re all disappointed in ourselves
I think with kaido it refers to how tough he is and not just his strength
Yeah
Squardo was able to stab wb
But he can’t stab kaido
Yeah
Wb in terms of raw power
But kaido is a combination of power and toughness
Wb could’ve used haki obviously but squardo can’t stab kaido anyways
Not to mention that wb just took the hit
To show squardo how he loves him
Wdym zeph
> Really I'm hoping its explained how Kaido can be the strongest in the sea (like in the water). Not necessarily strength against aquatic creatures but in combat down there <@334119106959769610>  it just probably means that he is the strongest among all creatures not in all environments
If Marco said that then I can’t argue
Kureha celestial dragon confirmed
How much did kureha know anyway
I doubt she knows the true history
Roger was called by his real name then they changed it once he became too dangerous iirc
He tells wb “do you know what they call me these days”
<:FujiWoke:638345772953370624>
Who makes these things
Lmao it’s in the name
Funniest shit I’ve ever seen ngl
I mean at least they’re honest about their headcanon
They’re probably trolls
No horny plz
Don’t tell lies
Food
<:akainuban:608389100583780353>
The hardest part of break week is how dead this server is
<:Crydo:586275183032270849>
Isn’t your powerscaling headcanon too
Nah one kiku is beautiful and strong enough
Who doesn’t simp kiku
<:FujiWoke:638345772953370624>
Rabbit and carrot in one dish
Nice
<:FujiWoke:638345772953370624>
I’d rather not
Lmao
Homemade burgers are the best
It’s just meat in a pan gaben
How can you fuck it up
Lmao
I don’t like where this is going
Gaben what’s wrong with you
Add more potato ?
I feel you gaben
Where did you get those carrot gifs gaben. I need them
Give me it.  now
Short hair is always best
Carrot knows what’s up
He’s a savage
<a:fastcarrotlaugh:740450178607349780>
Paulie who got beat by hattori
<a:EvilHattori:641498690279702542>
There’s  no chapter I swear
Like in 6 days
Yeah soon
<:Crydo:586275183032270849>
Is Monet an animal
<a:NamiRunning:585643147086921737>
Pirate them then
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
Is that alcohol
Damn hattori has issues
That’s legit cool

This is my favorite
Edo era art is the best

Lmao
Guys you’re forgetting the best outfit in op

Doesn’t t sanji look cute
^

Oda is a genius
They can’t use their power if they’re cuffed by seastone coded
What ? When did luffy so that
Bege used a seastone spear on Cesar in zou and he couldn’t use his power
> oh I mean isnt sea stone and sea supposed to have the same effect <@703504844903940096>  seastone is like the concentrated essence of the sea
Sea water is weaker than seastone bc seastone is the essence of the sea water than nullifies the devil fruit power
<@!415999229564157955> yeah the marines can do that bc seastone is part of the sea that’s why it has the same effect, but I would imagine that seastone is some kind of mineral or salt that is part of the sea water that is then used in a higher concentration so it has a stronger effect
Sea clouds ?
Technically yeah
Hopefully we see all the sh shine
The only one who shines in wci was turkey brook
Brook needs some turkey meat
Too weird
But he liked it
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
This needs to stop ASAP
Mods please help I’m scared
We need a chapter ASAP the server is getting outta control rn
<a:usoppno:470029376348487701>
^
I can see sabo fighting akainu since the revolutionaries are going after the wg so akainu could step in, but I don’t see it happening for the grudge or such
Ace and luffy are both pirates. It was his job
Spandam went ok at overboard with his job ngl
Well momo is really growing lately thanks to luffy so I’m actually loving him rn
Luffy telling momo to speak for him self instead of relying on his retainers was amazing
Stoop focusing on what really matters in op
Two breaks in a row is too much
Chapter break chapter break so technically yeah
At least we get 3 chapters now
Knocks on woods
Oda didn’t take breaks in the first 5 years only iirc
Then he was forced to
We lose either way then.  Thx stoopid
Bro I cried when roger laughed
I was scared
My anxiety is through the roof rn knowing the end is near
Taste probably. I for example don’t like slice of life anime no matter how good it is
I can see the world go into chaos when op ends
Some people will react in some weird ways
Oof
You need a new psychiatrist due
Op will def get new readers after it ends. I mean look at cowboy bebop
How would you even make real life poneglyphs
<@!383464767421153290> I’m no psychiatrist, but I don’t think that telling you not to kill yourself bc you wound be able to watch the shows you like isn’t good advice. I think they should focus on the core problems. Agian I’m no psychiatrist so my opinion is not valid and this isn’t the place to talk about it anyway.  Hope you get better, I feel you bro
I was attacked by a goose once
Little piece of shit is strong
I don’t even know how to escape a goose ffs
Let’s see you grabbing it’s neck when it’s attacking you. They’re vicious
Wings beaks and their weight
They’re fucking monsters
Peacock df would be useless. They can’t even fly
You would look beautiful tho
Flashback to peacock looking Phoenix tattoos
No plz stop
No cockroach
