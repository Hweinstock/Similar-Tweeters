What's different, bean?
Personally: "Get the weapons" is more rough-fodder-like than "arm yourselves"

here Bean
Middle
It's a detail tho
And that translation removes the "Oden's Ryuo" part, doesn't it? Now I gotta check the raw
> And that translation removes the "Oden's Ryuo" part, doesn't it? Now I gotta check the raw <@!415999229564157955> The raw says "Koitsura mo Oden no Ryuo wo?" So not having "Oden's ryuo" in the translationis kinda wrong there. He's saying smth like "These guys also have Oden's Ryuo?"
Unless I'm wrong and Oden can mean somthing else than Oden

Lame chat
It'll be an avalanche of sulongs
I predict minks climbing Kaido like they're some crazy mfs
It does
That's how he flies
D: When Kaido turned into a dragon, did he like float in the air?  O: Heard dragons can fly in the sky by using the clouds, so Kaido's doing that by generating his own clouds and then walking from cloud to cloud. Does that make sense?
Volume 93
Oh
Bean, the super human
It should be musketeers and guardians, no? The mink army. We see the giraffe, so i assume he's the guardian giraffe
Oh minks already saw the moon, no Oda, nooo

What guy?
Never said I was a mod
You're too dumb for this conversation
Imagine not wanting people to get spoiled in other series
> They were just talking  about the concept of death <@!345807250109235201> using examples from other series lol
They did
> ||The actual reason I dislike dragonball, is actually because death means nothing lmao|| <@!345807250109235201> Tell me how this isn't getting into the specifics of how deaths work in this series.
Just did
In other series
That's a spoiler in itself lol
You're changing perception of a series
Yes, using other series examples is not allowed
You can just say "if people died all the time..."
> Not spoilers at all <@!345807250109235201> All the mods will disagree.
> People die in every series <@!345807250109235201> Not in every. Also, you said how they are meaningless in that series. When someone sees a death there, they will have their perception changed by what you said. Therefore, it spoiled the series
Then you're wrong and it's done
> Or did he really expect to save ace with all his crew without anuone dying <@!220515768897372160> It's about consent
Ramon, this is not about utilitarianism. If they decide to risk their lives to save a fellow crewmate and family member, they're doing it on their own
They're also pirates and warriors
> U think they can save ace without anyone dying? <@!220515768897372160> They decided to die
You're saying it's not the utilitarian way, but it never is when someone risks their life in a war
A war that is just a battle tho
> That‚Äôs like saying  anyone who signs up for the military ‚Äúdecides to die‚Äù <@!345807250109235201> They decide to risk their lives. Though yeah, poorly worded

Punching hurts, she is being smart
He didn't ruin Kanjuro, what do you mean?
I don't think so. What was bad specifically
Orochi thought that as long as he has the leader of the rebels (Momonosuke), Kanjuro can stop the act. It shows Orochi was too confident and that Kanjuro just really follows what Orochi says
Stop discussing the discussion u two. Ramon, I showed my interpretation, what do you see that counters it?
He thought he had all the cards
And getting Momo
Orochi was always that guy that, as soon as he sees he has an upper hand, he is blinded by delusions of victory. If he had doubted himself, he could've used his cards better
I don't use stupid as an insult. No reason
<:NamiFlush:625741106193367054>
In the end Orochi got what he wanted, yeah, I guess
The death was independent from the plans

How is it unlawful if he got to write the laws
> Is this a random Drawing or is Oda hinting some kind of affinity between Franky and Robin? <@!194504958249402368> Only if your head wants to
Haki does not nulify a DF power, it makes DF users show their true bodies
Ryuo means haki bro
Easier but wrong is not cool
Normal
Wano gave armament that name due to their theory of it having to flow to one place of the body
I say levely
Saying levely and reverie is still referring to the same thing. Eliminating Ryuo=Haki from the equation is changing the meaning of the word
Everyone getting something wrong doesn't make it right
What is right is dictated by the story, not by democracy

> this is a plot hole right ? <@!690158729685106749> Why?
Kaido tried to get info from the scabbards, u can just look at how Kaido says "oh they didn't really know anything" when he knows about Kanjuro
> zoro asks "why was your boss executed" and kinemon says "because he went to raftel with roger" <@!171861037438599169> You're simplifying the page. Go by steps to show why that's the interpretation
That's another interpretation, yeah
That's on u. Not the point of the discussion
> Ninjas are opposed to be epic, why is raizo so goofy üò° <@!206896898215378945> We reading the same series?
I quite like that One Piece thing
~~üíó
> I was 100% correct when i said the Scabbards did not have enough story/hype behind them <@!550837342517067786> reread pls
> yet their motivations were only fleshed out these last couple chapters <@!550837342517067786> Nah, u need to reread
> At least one <@!164215302689783811> Well, yes, but I'll go as far as to say at least two
<:KikuTriggered:638344544286408767>
Raizo even trimmed his beard there
Between 986 and 987, Raizo is like this: has no sword; has sword; has no sword and making ninjutsu hand sign; has a sword; has two swords.  MF has a sword summoning jutsu for sure
Yes, Robin had 100% development when she joined. <:ShanksYes:727411684095819856>   (More than Yamato for sure, but she still has time for it)
> Do they use haki for it? <@!306372168827273216> It's ninjutsu bro. Ninja arts. That's it. Oda also doesn't explain Hasshoken too much for example
How much more?
> Yamato definitely had a more memorable first appearance than nami <@!698761447835959337> Oh u saying u don't remember Nami pretending to be ill and then stealing the boat and treasure from the three Buggy pirates that Zoro fought later, leaving them with a storm that made them shipwreck? LOL POSER
> Yamato has nothing too interesting going on besides her being Kaidos daughter/son <@!550837342517067786> Ace? Personality?
> <@!415999229564157955>  I don‚Äôt tbh <@!564773067969265674> Yeah, I remember, but I'm joking, as it isn't a special moment at all for a first appearance
> and Ace is meh so far <@!550837342517067786> So out of all the interesting parts of Yamato in the last few chapters she appeared in, you dismiss them all and then say she has no memorable first appearance or any development (or in this case exploration of her persoality)?
It's like saying "if we ignore all the things that make Yamato not Nami, she is Nami"
> to get into the lacking f Yamato i would have to type out a paragraph in an active chat <@!550837342517067786> "I have no argument, therefore I'll say it would be too big". Give us a glimpse
> what would Yamato add to the crew? <@!550837342517067786> You were the one making the claims, now you want our claims to dismiss yours? Counter the arguments dude.
Like Luffy cares about roles if he isn't in need of more lol
> that is why all members have an arc BEFORE they join the crew <@!550837342517067786> Zoro joined after a quick fight with Morgan, if u consider that an arc. Nami joined before Arlong. Robin joined before her arc, EL (Alabasta was a little bit of her character).
It's about who they are, not *just* what they bring
> What is Yamato to Luffy right now? <@!550837342517067786> Yamato exists since the past month irl bro
> u did nopt tell me what Yamato brings because she brings nothing as of right now <@!550837342517067786> Do the Straw Hats need to bring something to the crew, or is this your headcanon that they need some role?
Then if Luffy wants Yamato to join, he'll have her join. If it is ultimatey what Luffy wants, then your argument is not strong
> Vivi was just an affiliate rather than a nakama <@!711869066142416936> She is a honorary member of the crew
> <@!703504844903940096> 1. Did he ever actually join. > 2. Did they have an established relationship when Luffy asked him to join <@!550837342517067786> Did Brook have?
For 2
Oh Brook had a relationship with Luffy when he asked to join him, 30 seconds after Luffy meets him. <:ShanksYes:727411684095819856>
Thank you for what? Oda does the picking, then Oda can pick Yamato bro

Oh yes abuse deserves death, how civilised we are today
Akainu is a genral of the dictators
The dictators are Im, Gorosei and the other celestial pests
> He even has his own goddamn secret military force <@!683663101186277416> He doesn't?
But the dictators are Im and Gorosei, bro
Akainu is a tool

Smoker leads a marine base that burns pirates lol
> Yes and he actively practices that while even going against the gorosei his commanders at times <@!683663101186277416> When did he go against the gorosei?
Then he is still a tool
For the actual dictators
He does
Sengoku sent Saul to fuck Ohara up
> Sengoku started the war with Whitebeard <@!340565781806972942> War is war. However, he did order a person to be executed due to their father being the pirate king. Shitty af
Killing by association, eugenics. Sengoku was shitty too
Nah he says his bloodline should not exist
> What no he had ace executed cause he was the 2nd comander of wb pirates <@!276525516302057486>

Dude, stop. He didn't want to continue the war
I'd love if Shanks crew did like a haka or some tribal war cries when their ship is approaching an enemy ship, then the sky is like black above them and the enemy only gets to hear from a distance and then see some crazy dudes with tongues out and hitting their weapons against each other, against themselves, against the ship to make that crazy mf sound while staring at the enemy. My headcanon is sick
Man that image of Shanks crew needs to be real
Oda pls
> Is zoro confirmed shimotsuki <@!564773067969265674> He's confirmed Roronoa
!loro3
Yeah we don't. We know he was in Shimotsuki village and that he was a pretty difficult kid to deal with
But new info about past doesn't need to come in flashbacks
> sanjis backstory was so cold and zoros was just his friend dying from stairs <@!231759510014918656> "just", get youself together bro
> How is it realistic? Only unborn children die from stairs <@!564773067969265674> You clearly have no knowledge about this
People die from stairs all the time
Plus, "falling down the stairs" might also mean "suicide", it's an expression in japan iirc
> <@!509083474955599874>  I fell from the top of high stairs in second grade right on my face and I‚Äôm still here <@!564773067969265674> Anecdotal evidence is not good evidence. Thousands die from falling from stairs. It's how you fall and what may have been damaged. Don't just mock victims by saying only "unborn children" die from stairs.
> <@!415999229564157955>  ik zoros backstory was sad as well but when u compare the two <@!231759510014918656> Why would you feel the need to compare them, though?
Are you young?
Because that's something I'd say when I was like 7
If you can't understand simple anatomy, I can't help you
Being part of the buggy pirates says nothing. Saying the shit they said tells us about their age and/or pure ignorance
Malicious ignorance, even, saying some people deserve to die
<#456573949120217089> Learn the rules before saying shit
You saying people deserve to die because they are weak
I am. People die from this shit. I study at the hospital, I won't just mock victims of physical trauma
Sure.
!jazz suggest <MipAli #6357 - if this dude can just say people deserve to die if they fall from stairs because they're weak, joking or not, and stay without a warning or a mute for it, rules 2 and 4 matter not on this server.>
Yall really wanting Boa to lose
Hm why?
She doesn't have to lose this battle, though. The system is down right now
> what would she do if she won <@!509083474955599874> Continue being the pirate empress
Boa Marigold knows advanced armament. Boa Hancock has all three types. Amazon Lily is a land of warriors
Doesn't need it, but having someone in their ranks who has it is big
Boa can win against Koby all day. I can imagine possibilities of him winning, sure. I don't think he is affected by her sexyness, as he's already seen the sexiest in the world, Alvida
> I wonder if Kobe a simp or if the marines disciplined him enough <@!611703107231154190> When he thinks of "beauty", he thinks of getting fucked up by a certain cub
> koby is only a simp for Luffy <@!521427565492305931> The battle of Luffy's lovers
The hardest, most fiery love wins
I can't see those dudes winning against Amazon Lily and Kuja Pirates without *something* new. Seems like the match is really unfair now
Those mfs need to start putting stuff in the papers
I swear

Question "What's the arc named Thriller Bark?"
Thriller Bark saga lowkey pre-Camie Saga
It's the saga before Camie Saga
There's Pre-pro-Camie Saga, Pro-Camie Saga, Pre-Camie Saga, Camie Saga, Post-Camie Saga, Post-post-Camie Saga (current)
> all arcs build up to thriller bark even Wano <@!521427565492305931> With Moria and the actual Thriller Bark appearing in the "Wano saga", you're not wrong
How the fuck did Moria get Thriller Bark to go through the Red Line to get to the New World
> if you can‚Äôt go under the redline go over it <@!521427565492305931> To go over u need permission from the WG tho... Unless Moria went on the side like a boss
Moria used balloons to cross the Red Line. Great theory
Nah, they Neko's
Inuarashi has musketeers
I think we see the black cat and the giraffe musketeers

> only admiral i've seen anything related to wano would be sakazuki with his flower tattoos that are super similar to old man hyogoro or whatever <@!112963866589147136> Fujitora's kimono
And sword shit
> can‚Äôt wait to see odens flashback stretched for 10000 episodes <@!231759510014918656> Hopefully
WB saying his heart got hurt when his kids' daddy left him
We getting an episode letsa go
You can in various ways, tho unethical
Nah mate
Too dangerous to medicate bro
Yeah but BM for nakama
> like what <@!123129548752551937> Sharing food when she loses her memory <:FranKEKer:635609882438926376>
BM aint about them eugenics
BM wants diversity so much she kidnapped men to have kids and them got rid of them
Basically meaning forcing men to make kids
Not good lol
She'd be a serial sexual criminal irl
> I would totally live in tottland if I were in the op world, sure there‚Äôs a small lifespan tax but the quality of life is worth it imo <@!345807250109235201> Just don't be a strange race to BM tho
> SHE ATE HER MOM <@!606196171307745308> Not with malicious intent
Now kidnapping and forcing husbands to make kids she did with such intentions
She's evil for sure
That's a great face
I like how quick it is
Hiyori is a chad
> Ok I‚Äôm in ep 7 I think? Every character with the exception of buggy is hot <@!190654961934270465> LOL haha
Zoro, the role model
Solid ship
otoko is not otoko tho
> this picture reminds me of perona <@!231759510014918656> Yeah I can see some lowkey Perona vibes
But I love the colours these last eps
> I mean every one piece girl does look the same tbh lmao <@!286343745077510145> Wrong
They are all different
Or mostly all different

you'll like it
Maybe in <#714694214855819344> you can talk without getting spoiled tho
Read the rules
Of that channel ahah
Oh that's fine. But you'll get spoiled
Luffy is with Hyo <:BuggySweat:704463253819883611>
Hiyoro
This dude isn't ok
Ah
Does that have spoilers?
Yeah it does
Hyo is describing haki
It's in the past
Animation is amazing
And I love love love Wano's colours
> ~~bonchan?~~ <@!445046828824789002> Bon Kurei is now the Queen of Newkamaland, level 5.5. However, Newkama is a culture of people who transcend gender because they've tried all of it. So for someone to be the Queen, it would make sense for them to be able to grant such wishes, like Iva did with his hormones. That's why I'd love if Oda said that Bon Kurei awakened his DF and can now transform others
New Chopper>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
It wasnt
Monster Point is cooler now bc it lets him say stuff like this
>  > <@!171861037438599169> where did it even come from other than his flag having that design > <@!289876647354826752> Maybe characters talking about his body being strange and Luffy and Zoro saying it's "them" - possibly meaning Teach and his crew but another interpretation is that BB is more than one person in some way
AnM
Jinbe is just jumping from party to party - Party in FMI, WCI's wedding, the party with the fish-men after WCI, the party after Wano
Koby dying too
Good thing u ain't the writer bro
> It seems like regular armament but he was deflected due to basic logic <@!564773067969265674> It's advanced
Well the party was after they treated the wounded
The admirals just didn't care
Gaben, don't help that person derail the convo
> Would Koby not care about beauty and stuff like Luffy or he would react like a normal human <@!363700749370261514> MF lived two years of his childhood having to say an ogre is the most beautiful woman, so one can only assume the consequences ~~Sanji~~
> Minks aren‚Äôt attracted to humans right <@!564773067969265674> Who knows
OHHHH
Yeah
yes
She can just use her super mega powerful Haoshoku
> i mean all the minks are with them?? <@!581506999657955367> The mink warriors
I don't think there's any mink children there
> There‚Äôs probably more to coc <@!564773067969265674> What we know now: - Bang bang bangs weak af mfs that wouldn't even be worth fighting - Skilled playas can pick who they choose to spare - A skilled playa could fuck a cool boat
> Do you think the sulong forms would look savage or like elegant like carrot <@!662544074015899649> We've seen both
If they're all white with red eyes and motherfuckerly, I accept either way
Carrot Sulong again will fight with the SH and be part of the crew
Inu is calm, meaning he doesn't use all of his motherfuckerness and anger, so he'll use it all now <:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
Neko is always using it
They've been presented as equal
she looks amazing
I'm a manga elitist, ama
no
I refuse that description

Who on earth would say that Toko saying she wants to see a kappa and then laughing is a bad addition?
yall ger Ririka in the first episodes lol
Ririka is Rika's mother u dumb dumbs
Posers
Reread
I got into OP bc some friends kinda liked it. Now I like it more than them
I bought my first figure in the first day of watching
lol that print

I loved biochem
Biochemistry is really cool
> Biochemistry from my experience is lots of memorisation but it is very interesting <@!662544074015899649> Well you gotta know the pathways, so if you understand those it becomes more logical than memory
What's your problem? Creating problems where they don't exist
I lived in less than 197
How much do yall think Kaido weighs?
in numbers
Also how high do yall think he was at the live stage
> 800 pounds maybe <@!407999944675295265> International system units pls
> 100KGs <@!198930928083402753> That's a fat human
> i was not expecting a full moon lol <@!497725914369490996> They planned it to be a full moon since the beginning
Oh the sulong
yeah
LOL its that even a match?
> In the anime ..kaido was still drunk when hitting luffy. And he sobered up when said luffy still angry at him unconsciously. Even when leaving, he said, he's going back get more drunk. (I suppose that's not canon.<@!407999944675295265> <@!736943713439449099> That is canon
Kaido says he aint getting Law bc he was sober and wanted to drink
> Wasn‚Äôt bear guy in the background in the manga <@!564773067969265674> Nah, there was a bear gifter but he looked different. So we can't make a clear connection
The bear gifter had a human head inside his mouth, but his bear part was bear like and not plush like
Pretty cool Oda
> Because someone insisted CP0 was a bad and dangerous job when it's probably the second or third highest position in the world? It's both those things. A dangerous and powerful position. However, how can they be the second or third if there's Im, Gorosei, rest of CDs and Kong above them? That's like the fifth pfft
Maybe it will be about apple consumption. Speculation power

When does Roger have it in the flashback?
Shanks going back to get the Poneglyph would make sense. He could've been guarding Laugh Tale that way
How many Poneglyphs does the WG have tho?
Even if they can't read them
Pluton is just a nice ship
How does Poseidon help create the red line? Make the sea creatures work?
The Red Line too big for giants tho
Well we see big whales blocking currents before, big creatures can do it no prob
> kaido could just one shot each sea king one by one from the sky <@!289876647354826752> Bro u know how many there are and what they are?
Sea Kings are highly intelligent, they don't need to kill everything they see
Evidence is that that's the weapon with the power to destroy the world
Are there only 1000 sea kings?
Or is this speculation the damage of 1000 sea kings?
Small sea kings are sea kings
But a lot of big ass ones are crazy
Oh but those big ones are the same, aren't they?
It's interesting that those are the same we see in the Calm Belt
These dudes eat sea kings
Sea kings are really diverse - that's the conclusion
Zunesha looks something like this, from OP Magazine
Sea Kings are fast. Zunesha is slow in comparison too
But if Sea Kings don't attack Zunesha it's for a reason, no?
Sea Kings also don't attack the Kuja snakes
The big ones
<#522036834310815744>
Yeah, and Zunesha could have a tough skin <:FranKEKer:635609882438926376>
> If Shirahoshi ordered them to they might <@!477218487903977483> They will
> I think the sea kings we saw during FMI arc, were actually rather intelligent and seems to mind their own business. But, i think not all sea kings are the same <@!526953063089438720> Well those are the ones that attack Merry too so
Zunesha and the Sea Kings are friends and just talk it out
The thing is, if there are many sea kings like those in calm belt, why did Oda reuse some in FMI
Yamato is not superficial. Deep down she has organs too, she ain't just skin and hair
Prove me Yamato doesn't have lungs
I just think it's better to assume she has internal organs than say Yamato is superficial
> Can robin grow limbs inside of people <@!564773067969265674> If she can make a clone of herself, can she just sprout blood everywhere?
> <@!415999229564157955>  can she grow a mouth inside of kaido and bite his heart ? <@!564773067969265674> Doesn't she have to see it tho (iirc)? If that's the case she'd have to create eyes inside his mouth and esophagus and then the mouth where the heart is. I believe in her
> <@!415999229564157955>  I don‚Äôt think that she can see his heart form his throat but good point <@!564773067969265674> She can't, but heart (specifically the left atrium) is directly in front of his esophagus (which goes to your stomach, it doesn't stay in the throat), so she'll see where it beats and just bite that part. She'll get the heart for sure, as it is really close. The esophagus is so close to the heart that the left atrium has an esophageal impression. Of course Oda knows this
Oda needs to know
Carrot hate? No it has pre-Carrot love. They are still ignorant
> But the fact that she just us alive and hasn't done anything heart moving or anything is pretty obvious that shes a side character <@!521783526878609418> Nothing? Reread
Nah you made a claim she did nothing heart moving and that it made it obvious she was a side character. Those are claims about the story, not just opinions
Saying "what she did didn't impress me" is an opinion. Saying she didn't do anything that makes her more than a side character is a claim to be discussed, not an opinion
> She cried when someone died? Damn bro you right she's the best character <@!521783526878609418> Reading comprehension. She cried over her dead mentor. However, her character was way more than just crying from sadness in that page. She was showing her character, her relation to Pedro, her relation to Sanji, how she thinks it isn't his fault and doesn't blame him, how she understands what Pedro would have wanted, how she wants to follow it but the emotions are more than she can control. That's creating layers to a character, something Oda does well.
Also strawman arguments would be greatly appreciated out of here
That's not an opinion
You simplified an argument
But it is done
My part of this convo was not about her joining, but about the claims made to her character
Kaido will say "FINALLLYYYY" and kill himself
Depends tho
What if Kaido a little man inside that big body being controlled by an evil genius? As I said, depends
Kyoshiro was obviously Denjiro and it happened that way
<:ShanksHmmm:586437070742880257> no
That was corrected
It was corrected to a square
That makes sense cmon
> Imagine not understanding sarcasm <@!521783526878609418> You know there are people who simply can't, I hope
It wasn't
I hate One Piece
I come here to laugh at One Piece fans
> <@!274366418223497217> ya but if we can't argue about power levels then what is there left to talk about? <@!272064319661801473> There's a lot of Thousand Sunny details to be known
I bet yall don't know how many toilets there are in the Sunny for example
> how do i subscribe to daily thousand sunny facts? <@!272064319661801473> Just see where I am, I'm the Thousand Sunny facts
> If you count the aquarium, 5 <@!173952257635778560> Locations. And aquarium does not count lol
The sunny has a toilet above the library. Two under both staircases that go to the helm. That's all, 3
Toilets not meaning bathrooms
Just the toilet
> Why do they need that many <@!419608704418054157> Too many people
Also, if someone is taking a bath in the giant bathroom and another is just pooping right at the entrance, the smells will not be great
The toilet above the library is a different room from the bathroom. Under the stairs is just toilets. In the entrance of each room there is a little place with a sink to wash hands, brush your teeth etc
Everyone should know this info
Basic knowledge. How will I build my real life Thousand Sunny and live in it if I don't even know where I'd put the toilets? pfft
For the toilets under the stairs and the sinks
> But I think strawhats boys might occasionally have like a group bath like alabasta or whatever <@!419608704418054157> Idk about that, but they do wash all their clothes together in the same place. Nami and Robin wash theirs every day
People with specific rooms to work on: Franky, Usopp, Chopper, Sanji (kitchen) Jinbe stays at the helm. Nami makes her maps at the library. Robin stays at the library studying too. Luffy just goes on the head and Zoro spends time training at the big boy room ALL THIS MEANS BROOK NEEDS A PIANO
Petition for a piano in the Sunny
> Wait there‚Äôs no cartography room? <@!272064319661801473> In the library, Nami has her own desk. Also, everyone has books there expect Luffy (maybe Jinbe now)
The library is a pretty cool place bro
Yes, but she gets a cool desk
Nah, Nami likes to look outside bro. She needs a place where she can do that. Usopp, Franky, Sanji and Chopper don't have that panoramic view. Also the library is quiet, unless the toilets below are full and people need to go up. Being in a separated block helps too
> usopp got a whole room for his slingshot <@!272064319661801473> Him and Franky do a lot of shit tho
> Damn Giolla <@!521427565492305931> I remember watching that with fear my precious Sunny would stay like that
Also, Gerumpel, Franky listened to the SHs' requests. So Nami wished to stay there
He does tho
He builds his weapons and builds weapons for other SHs
He also must help with fixing weapons on the ship, like the cannons
Yes. Nami isn't someone who stays in a place like that without a window bro
Nah, they do different stuff bro
She has a pretty cool place to do her work
> easy, move the library to usopp's factory <@!272064319661801473> Don't do that to Robin and Nami bro. They like to be there
> zoro reads? <@!272064319661801473> "How to clean your sword" probably
BRUH
We are discussing Sunny details
And others are discussing Katakuri
I know a lot about the Sunny, I should stop
Tell me what you wish to know
LOL Yamato a blacksmith
> Idk what do you wanna tell me about <@!564773067969265674> So we talked about Sunny having three toilets (one below each stair that goes to the helm - so 2 - plus the one above the library, one bathroom (above the library) and that the boys' room and the girls' both have sinks at the entrance to wash hands, brush teeth, etc.  Then we talked about the workplaces of each Straw Hat  Usopp and Franky both have a workshop at the basement Sanji gets the kitchen Chopper has an infirmary  Jinbe now has the helm. Nami has her own desk at the library to draw her maps and Robin stays at the library studying too. Luffy just does his thing on the head. Zoro trains at the gym that exists above the mast But Brook has no PIANO. HOW DOES BROOK NOT HAVE A PIANO
Nami seems to like those big ass baths, like she says on the way to FMI
> Have we seen anyone in one piece brush his/her teeth? Idr <@!736943713439449099> We know it happens bc Oda wrote so on the blueprints. The boys' room has tooth brushes there.
<:RobinSmug:485147535875244032>
BTW Sunny had a pool... had.... we need it back
Chopper in the pool, what a chad
> Only one other cat has it If we don't count Zepo, who is currently imprisoned. Nami had an invisibility technique, but non-canon in the anime
Not Zepo ahhh
Zeo
> Nami's invisibility is canon <@!114296407816404992> It is? Hm.. My mind bamboozled me
Well in EL I thought she was one of the clones
Not completely invisible
But I guess I'm wrong
> But she never made herself invis or used the clones after that <@!576551753496002571> She was invisible in the anime in FMI. Need to check the manga
Is that image the source for the Ryou=Advanced Armament? tss
Don't want to derail convo there, so <@!134857202446893056> <@!114296407816404992> this is what I was talking about. She is one of the clones in EL
When we were talking about Nami's invisibility
If u weren't there, sorry, I must have remembered wrong
OHHHHHHHHHH that's it
I didn't remember that
Thank you
There are always new characters, but idk
Ah there's time
Well Croco came to the new world
I think
Nah Sanada is the one whose channel is pure flex
Sanada just shows him owning like 4 versions of the same figure
Sanada is the guy who has the biggest One Piece collection in the world. He also appears in A LOT of SBS saying pervy things
Kuro will never come back bro
When I went to buy that one, it was already sold out. Maybe they're out again. When I get the chance I'll see
Six powers, Hasshoken, Ninjutsu... those are all independent
Vivre cards say six powers are haki?
> what about king punch <@!735212306882887801> Independent
easily, gottem
What does Kumadori have in his abilities that relates to Wano?
Oh so aesthetics
> And they may not have a concept of observation either tbh <@!114296407816404992> Knowing how they specialized in swords, I'd guess as much
They can use observation, but might not understand it. In Sky Island they didn't understand armament (or they'd have some chance to go against Enel), but they knew observation pretty well. Cultures will be cultures
Marco Costa
> Doesn‚Äôt kaido know what haki is <@!564773067969265674> He does, but he's been on that island for 20 years bro, he'll speak like Wano people a bit
No
Hyo just learned what haki was when Luffy talked about armament
He says "haki" and not "armament haki" bc he just learned the word
How do you know they can't make swords aware, Bean? Lack of imagination

This dude's mind "uses heart emoji, is girl, need to harrass"
Dumb fans: 988 will be about Sulong minks fighting Kaido with the Scabbards  Oda: 988 will be about Franky and Brook finding something unrelated, like the Poneglyph

**More Kiku** and Hiyori
> No need for this color type of haki <@!376748967137902594> The colour when Hyo and Luffy use advanced haki or those auras like Zoro has in the anime?
In the anime, advanced haki is like it is in the manga bro
That's your opinion
Oda literally has an aura in the manga for advanced haki
> Oden overflowing with some shit aura and kaido too they do it with luffy vs kaido <@!376748967137902594> Those auras were strange, Zoro one seems to be an addition too. But advanced haki looks cool
You're talking about the visual representation in the anime so..
<:ApooPoint:714023366356500531>
Even my mother doesn't like it
> Thats why its always subpar <@!376748967137902594> You gotta be careful with those "always". The anime has pretty cool moments
I love the post ts colours, for example
> Fuck <@!376748967137902594> Is this a thing against colours in general?
Oda already said that experienced CoC users can pick who to spare. So there are already ways to make your CoC better. If we will get advanced techniques is smth else

No one can cry, it's actually impossible
Your expectations may be influenced by the environment, but your expectations are your fault in the end, at least in this situation. So people saying "oh he cried, I thought a scabbard would die, and that youtuber said we shouldn't see spoilers, man this chapter didn't need that, I was so hyped" are just showing they chose to use those clues to create high expectations
Imagine not knowing who lil Chouchou, the cutie is
Did you cry at Fisher Tiger's death?
If not, you're not a fan
True fans above
Imagine kicking animals
This -„Ç∑„É•„Ç∑„É• - reads as Shushu, but the name was romanized as Chouchou. I'll allow that excuse

> how is it that he was captured so many times and not killed <@!703504844903940096> Not enough rage from the marines
To me it seems Kaido is wondering what the fuck just happened and not actually making a claim of similarity. But I understand that's also a possibility
> Funny how 'mass deaths' in one piece is 2 <@!703504844903940096> Koby was hearing the people die. Moria used zombies of fallen marines and pirates too, iirc
Mass death is mass death. Mass named characters deaths are not common in OP, sure

> Unless having multiple moons changes some part of the show, it's entirely irrelevant <@!114296407816404992> Would you say the same about Sunny details?
But Sunny details give me joy
Different cycle durations. the OP moon doesn't have to be as far from their planet as the moon is to us
> the op world is not that technologically advance <@!495255829369454612> It is more than use in some things, less in others
How do u know OP's planet isn't the center of the galaxy?
> <@!415999229564157955>  > Basic things like orbiting the sun probably are the same in the one piece world m8 if the earth was the center many things would be completely different <@!521783526878609418> With our physics, sure. OP is fictional to the core. No one can do ninjutsu, bro.
But yeah, it's fine to assume OP's earth is not the center of the universe, but it isn't crazy to claim the contrary
> Ig but if you wanna say that none of our physics apply to one piece than literally everything we know of most of one piece would be different <@!521783526878609418> Not really, why would that be?
> The gravational force needed to literally everything would be different <@!521783526878609418> Not if Oda says "the force is the same on OP's world"
No, Oda can say "only on earth the force is the same"
That's lack of imagination
Yeah. But I still go with one moon bc that's all we've been shown. Until there's a clear indication of more than one, I won't change that opinion. However, it's more than possible that there are a lot of moons
!hottake
All the moons shown were alone. When we see more than one moon at the same time, then we can falsify the claim that there is only one moon. Until then, I don't think we should claim there's more, even if the possibility remains
> I feel like in a world with people who can kick the air to walk on it multiple moons isn't that crazy <@!521783526878609418> Yeah it isn't

Fruits are different, that's it
Maybe Akainu doesn't have the power to have infinite storage
Swamp swallowing stuff makes sense. Black holes too. A vulcano, tho... Oda's fruits are always very thematic
Like Viola, she has the "glare glare" (giro giro) fruit, but she can create tear whales (as that is a pun with the word for corner of the eye iirc). It's magic, that's it
> I forgot; was Kiku also sent in time? <@!199878649426477056> She was

Zoro's arc was Romance Dawn, don't fool yourselves
He is fire
Plants die with fire
Ricardo loses
Some morals... Morality itself is subjective. To him, he could be doing the most moral thing
If you compare to the mainstream view of morality irl, almost none of the OP characters behaves in a moral way. Some worse than others
> If he was the good guy he would want peace <@!698761447835959337> Luffy is a bad guy
> But even real life morals are not that great <@!564773067969265674> Well I'm biased to agree, but it's a good way to compare
Nah she is bad. If you want to end racism but kidnap and force men to have children with you, you're bad
> Luffys liberated one to many countries to be a bad guy <@!698761447835959337> But he wants war, so your own definitions are flexible, which takes from their validity
Not how it works
If the bad guys create the war, sure. If you create the war, who's the bad guy?
> Were the marines bad for wanting to execute ace? <@!703504844903940096> For sure
> Yeah but it's war against the bad guys <@!698761447835959337> War itself is bad unless it's a necessity. You should be arguing that it is a necessity, not that they are fighting the bad guys. "Bad guys" is relative. That's the mentality that creates unnecessary wars
> luffy on the other hand released soo many criminals <@!703504844903940096> Something obviously bad
> it was buggy that released most of the criminals <@!297795816255389697> Without Luffy, Buggy wouldn't have done shit
Yeah, for most Akainu is seen as a force for good, even if he kills those who oppose him and uses the death penalty
> a lot of people in the east blue had smaller goals Not the chad Krieg
Buggy had a map to the grand line and he kinda likes treasure, I think the raid in Orange Town was meant to be temporary
> <@!415999229564157955> Kaidos ruinied one to many countries to not be the bad guy <@!698761447835959337> I'm not arguing that he is not the bad guy. I'm saying Luffy is not a good guy
At most he is neutral
> would luffy help a country where he didnt like anyone <@!703504844903940096> X for doubt
WB yeah
What does Bonney do? Steal food?
She was all scared bc of some CDs
Krieg is a real pirate
Good in relation to what? Other pirates?
If so, sure
Kidd is not the most pirate like, because he cares about his own crew too much. A real pirate like BB and Krieg can't care less
Pirates aren't just savages who like hurting people, they are people who don't care about the way to get power. They steal ships and kill to gain treasure. They do not see their crews as something that important
> a crew of savages would fall apart super fast  Depends if there's a cult of the leader of sorts. Vikings on mushrooms could do their thing pretty well
Franky le badass
Jinbe was carrying Nami and Chopper, therefore those will almost die and be saved by Jinbe <:CrocoKidZoom:661610502543114290> yes, I'm a OP theorist
That spread is linked to Ace's death for sure, it seems to deliberate not to
Luffy didn't change enough to have a fleet officially under his name like Lord Buggy
Lack of strength caused him not to save Ace, it didn't cause the death itself, though for Luffy there's no difference
So that person being used as Kaido was actually BM?
they aren't canon
they weren't written by Oda
What's canon is Ace left Dawn Island, he formed the Spade Pirates, he went into the new world, he met shanks, he fought Jinbe, he fought WB and went in his crew, he tried to kill WB multiple times... That's all canon and is in the novel too, the rest isn't
the wiki says it is canon, it isn't
The source is it not being made by Oda and not being any different from other supervised works
If Oda says "this all happened in the story", then it's canon
> Can we agree its half canon then lol <@!593768510304288768> Enlightened Centrism
It was not a compliment
Debunked
> never shows the marines with haki <@!160778857702490113> It clearly shows some of them are not running
Orochi has too much confidence
Wano, Jinbe, cool dude in Alabasta
> What did ace achieve ? As a character <@!564773067969265674> Everything in his childhood with Luffy and Sabo; created a crew, became a supernova, met Shanks; he and Jinbe fought for 5 days, where they made a cool connection; he was one of WB's commanders; he tried to kill WB multiple times - at least - which tells us about his personality; he then saw one of his subordinates killed a member of the family and went out of his way to get him; his intro in Drum Island was cool af with him stopping the snow; then in Alabasta he was the cool bro - destroying the ships and stopping Smoker, fought BB finally, just to know BB was now a lot more powerful than before; and then everything that leads to the war; we now know he was in Wano and made connections there too. Also we know a lot about his thoughts on Roger. So he is a pretty complex character.
Big Mom is really cool
If you have to diverge conversation to a video, do you really hold any arguments? Can't you formalize them?

You only lose arguments if you claim wrong stuff is right. If you say what you remember is something and ask for clarification, you win when you know it was wrong. Just claim stuff you're sure about
Easy

BINGO - inserts lung cancer
> Guys.... It's scars we are talking about not tattoo? <@!306372168827273216> Yes, we like scars
As I said, scars tell stories in OP's world
Nami tattooed over it. But she used to be shown with a scar behind the actual tattoo
Chopper, Law and Marco
My body is fragile
> Nami's got a scar on her back that isn't tattoed <@!114296407816404992> It was shown a lot pre-ts, but I don't remember seeing that one post
It's sad that she doesn't have the scar anymore

From chap 105

Yeah I was gonna show that
She risked it

Manga fillers bro
LOL
He has what it takes to be the leader of the SHs, that's it
Reread
Imagine wanting to be Pirate King and not fighting the strongest to get there
That's why he has a crew with different abilities and is not by himself. He acknowledges he can't be Pirate King without them
His goal is to be the man with the most freedom, the king of the pirates. His goal comes from meeting Shanks, to whom he made the promess to become an even greater pirate than him
Chapter 1 stuff
We're talking about the manga bro
The first point is wrong because Luffy's personality evolves, especially when his brother died. He was always the guy who ran first into an enemy, but that proved not to be enough when his crew was defeated so easily by Kuma and once he saw he couldn't save his brother effectively. Therefore, he chose to change and give himself time to get better, something almost out of character. Luffy is also the guy who can read others' emotions and makes people rely on him with how much he cares about his friends and ignores the enemy's authority, as his goal requires him to defeat everyone in his way. However, Luffy understands that he can't do it alone, that's why he has a crew, and that's why he doesn't have to be the perfect MC
That's the style of the manga. If you can't bring yourself to like it, then that's it
LOL
Weren't the others real?

Don't do that, Doom, the fish-man anti-segregation police will come to get u
Sanji can just bring the drinks directly through the mast
It's a really cool place
But yeah, you know I'm a biased Sunny enthusiast so
Sunny is a lot cooler to understand and know just because it has more unique features
> sunny has 2 toilets <@!160778857702490113> 3* two below the stairs, one above the library
If by lookout you mean that round building behind the kitchen where the library and the bathroom is
The gym as no toilet
So yeah, Sunny has more toilets than Merry. Checkmate

> Where is brook in wano rn? I feel like we got updates on everyone‚Äôs positions but him and sanji? <@!372163979738349568> Franky, Brook and Sanji
Oda doesn't make the backgrounds alone iirc
He only 100% does the parts with movement
> For Oda to say a straw hat will die blantantly <@!237434464656031744> Brook is already dead u dum dum
96, but 97 should be coming, as there's enough chapters, I think
> As long as he achieves his goal <@!742532068608704532> Not even then. He just accepts if he has to die before reaching Laugh Tale, like we see in Loguetown
Y would Jinbe die
Why?
Oh yes the vibes
Give us a reason
Luffy aint letting a crew member die, or he'll not be PK
> If Jinbie dies, will you be surprised <@!237434464656031744> Yes, because he is a member of the crew
Jinbe isn't dying
If Jinbe is in the crew, then he can't die. That's it. Merry dying was enough
He mentioned it so u dum dums think he'll die
"Probably", yall don't know how to use that word
> Its a fair assumption to make as a theory tho<@!415999229564157955> <@!237434464656031744> Not how you use the concept of probability, though. What evidence is there that make that alternative more likely than others?
Possibility is not probability
You said that that possibility is more likely than others, thus probable. Which isn't the case unless there's evidence
> <@!415999229564157955> so you're saying you couldn't understand why the ope ope would have been used on Imu? <@!237434464656031744> If you continue to not understand what is being said, I'll quit trying to explain. You didn't say "Imu was *possibly* bestowed immortality by the original user", you said "*probably*". If you can't understand the difference in those statements and the need for evidence for the second, this conversation is over.
Not reaching, using the right words is important not to make false claims
You claimed probability
This is done
I'm not saying it was absolute, I'm saying you were saying it was something probable, which in itself is a claim
!os
How is that gay?
It's only valid if I understand what gay means there lol
oh, I see
> Man, the only thing you got out of what he said was one word? Lol <@!237434464656031744> I won't question your good faith, but do you know what a discussion is? We have to understand what the other is saying if we want to debate them. He used "gay", which is an unrelated word, to mean "dumb". One can only come to that conclusion after asking for clarification
The thing with loss of lifespan is that it is always a "a population who does this will live 20 years less than normal", so Luffy can still live 200 years and be an outlier
As I said, those conversations about lifespan are always about "if 200 people did this, the average age of death of that group will be X years less than of 200 people who do not do this". There's never a way to predict an individual's lifespan, unless you're Hawkins or Shyarly
we only see 1 moon, the scientific method tells us to accept that until new evidence falsifies the observations

> Then what kind of haki do you think Oden cut Kaido with <@!415999229564157955> ? <@!191063132053962753> Haki
Why should it, that's my question
> because that has been pushed as the only way to hurt kaido , luffy couldn't even scratch him in g4 <@!328936254978916352> The only way Luffy can hurt Kaido, though
Something like inherited haki seems more likely than the advanced haki we've seen so far
> ACoA doesn't just apply to going around defenses it allows you to cause more destruction overall <@!191063132053962753> Source
There's no current reason to assume the haki used as anything to do with the advanced techniques we've seen. It could be regular haki with some passion, inherited haki, or even a new form of advanced. In no way we can be sure
> Luffy could not break a CD collar without it, but he can crush one like a tin can with ACoA <@!191063132053962753> He destroys it from within, there's no mention he does more damage iirc, that's why I asked for a source
> I think this Inherited Haki shit is BS, Kaido was most likely just saying that the scabbards used the same Haki Technique as Oden, Not that its literally Odens Haki <@!269999048046411776> Yeah, could be. The many possibilities is why I say people saying they were using ACoA are making claims they can't defend
> <@!415999229564157955> exactly what do you think ACoA does? <@!191063132053962753> From what we've seen, it allows mission of haki to the air and internal destruction of enemies and objects
> <@!415999229564157955> No really defense for it but I do think its the most Viable option from what we know <@!269999048046411776> It's as viable as any other plausible alternative, inherited haki included
> How the hell does that not function as a damage increase to you then <@!415999229564157955> ? <@!191063132053962753> What we see it difference in location of haki (in the air, past someone's skin, etc.), not damage of haki itself. Again, source it.
> <@!415999229564157955> Ryou is literally every form of CoA including the ACoA. None of luffys strongest attacks coated in normal Armanent Haki were doing anything to Kaido. It was hinted at many times in Udon that the advanced form is needed to actually hurt Kaido. <@!352120879439675392> It just means that Luffy needs to attack beyond Kaido's skin, not that blades need to do the same
> You think that all internal destruction does is allow someone to hurt a character who's skin is too tough to get past with normal force, and nothing else? <@!415999229564157955> <@!191063132053962753> Luffy wanted to do damage beyond the skin because he couldn't pass through it, yes. If you have a source for it making more damage, you can show it
> Rayleigh removing the collar from camie was adv armament right ? Just like luffy removing Yamato‚Äôs cuffs. So adv armament does damage from the inside that‚Äôs how luffy and the scabbards can hurt kaido <@!564773067969265674> The thing is, the scabbards pierce Kaido, they don't do internal damage, or not *just* internal damage, as what we see is superficial damage
> I'm trying to understand why being able to bypass defenses doesn't count as a buff to the amount to damage someone is able to deal even if their attack doesn't technically have any more force behind it <@!191063132053962753> The thing is, the scabbards actually cut the skin. They aren't damaging (just) the inside, like Luffy is trying to do.
> Have you never played an RPG before? <@!415999229564157955> ? <@!191063132053962753> irrelevant
Ryuo means haki, pls use Advanced CoA or ACoA so we can all understand the discussion
If they used it in a single spot I can see it going through. That's obviously a possibility
> But we can see it's the same as what Hyou does, and seemingly what the scabbards do <@!372464153480134666> Can we *see* it though
> with a sword the damage will be internal anyway <:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045> <@!495255829369454612> But also superficial. Therefore what the scabbards used is different from what Luffy is trying to do
It's like WB vs Roger
But there's no indication that's what the scabbards did, is there?
Maybe this will be explained, maybe it will be left as is
> The part where the back of the tree is blown up is different than what Hyou does <@!372464153480134666> Yeah, some people here are not seeing that, as far as I understand
There was one dude here who couldn't see how what Luffy was doing was different from what the scabbards did

> I messed it up <@!521427565492305931> I like moths tho
No need for spoiler tags bro
Orochi is as dead as my party nights before the lockdown
So real dead
imagine having a command
Sanji is dum
> Why is the head of the merry brown in the colored manga? <@!162731766799532032> The paint isn't cheap
> haki can be inherited!!!!!!!!!! <@!280070473667051530> We don't know if it's metaphorical yet
It can be a metaphor because they could be using the same technique Oden used and not actually his haki
It is a methapor. Oden says his soul will live on and Kaido asks himself if they're using Oden's haki. Those could all be metaphorical
Red leg was due to the blood
right below the google definition lol
a thing regarded as representative or symbolic of something else.
A symbol can be metaphorical. "A cold heart" is a symbol of not caring about others' suffering; saying someone has a cold heart is being metaphorical.
> do yall think they will get new epihets after this? <@!280070473667051530> I wouldn't mind a Weather Witch Nami

Monet should've learned about life and gone with the SH
Show some mercy, Bahamas. Cute girls deserve it
Then why are they cute?
> <@!289876647354826752> At this point I'm fine whoever joins as long as it's not Carrot <@!655999751787118602> Carrot is already a SH
Reread
You're reading the wrong manga
Enel is dead, those were his dreams before dying of suffocation. The brains plays tricks like those
"from North Blue"
Man Monet would really be a good addition
I'm being honest
If Viola joined, Sanji would have a harder time in WCI

Kinda salty, are we?
Adam had an excellent observation in <#164971940648321024>
Possible
And now Moe is trying to make us think this is all a joke
I'm kind of a genius actually
<:CrocoMods:674104771661266944>
you wouldn't understand
I have a PhD in Onepieceology
I'm also a med student on the side tho
I was actually listing my many discoveries in the field, but I chose to be humble
Oh really? Have you heard of the H13V6D7 virus?
No? No need to thank me
That's right
That's also why I only listed one virus
Rookie stuff
0 bc u have nothin
Sure u have if u are saving people from non existent viruses
Kind of a fraud
pls don't let me go
What happens next
show me how
What if your words are actually mine
That's very much possible. Agreeing to the possibility of the situation shows intellectual superiority, or not... or maybe slightly
You just hesitated
oh
So intelligent, that one
some secs
Ok I'll admit I'm not a PhD in Onepieceology
My son has that name
One Piece will finally be known and stop being a rookie manga
as old as I am
oh no
I'm kinda one of those fats
Without the joined part
Wow fats doesn't remember me, pfft I thought we had a thing
In 2007 I was not doing intellectual things like watching One Piece. So much potential lost
> Hey <@!415999229564157955> I hope I didn‚Äôt go too far with the big brain jokes. It‚Äôs all in good fun buddy <@!564773067969265674> This is a sign of defeat <:FranKEKer:635609882438926376>
Nah it's all fine. I love those big brain takes
I was gonna buy the OP manga in japanese, might as well later. I think I'll just buy english for now
now meaning next years when I stop feeling like a pirate
I'll build a Thousand Sunny, fate. Join me
> Volumes are like 5 $ stoopid <@!564773067969265674> I only have money to eat and survive
5 dollars is like a lot of rice
Rice and pasta
Where I live at least
pasta, those spaghetti things
Those mac stuffs
But fr if I'd buy volumes those big boxes are the best option for fresh new
> Am I the only one who likes plain pasta <@!564773067969265674> I love it, just salt and water. Maybe some marguerine
Sensory pleasure is opened by meditation Ohmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Pasta, salt and maybe some oil and I'm good
No need for those secretions in my pasta
> <@!415999229564157955>  exactly, and then I drink the water with all the pasta and sauce essence <@!564773067969265674> Yes, a classic
If I'm feeling lucky, I soak the bread in the sauce
Peanut butter or no peanut butter with bananas?
Real questions
Right answer
Oh man
The good thing with pleasure from eating is that you can find it in a lot of places, Zyphyris
Depends who I'm trying to impress
If a country girl, on the fries. If some bourgeoisie girl, on the side
> The answer is Mayo <@!564773067969265674> My home-made mayo is real cool
> what if its a boy? <@!95648410492731392> Normally boys don't need the fries with me <:NamiFlush:625741106193367054>
Boys are more straight-forward
> Do you make pickles at home  too stoopid <@!564773067969265674> No, but would love to
Trying is part of the process
If u like it, u continue
Drink cow tit secretion <:WBDisgust:650047749831524372>
Imagine eating bee ass secretions
Bee vomit yeah, all the same
pbj I can accept
!disgusting
> What other animal secretion do humans eat <@!564773067969265674> So milk, honey, eggs...
Do humans eat that?
Interesting. I guess if the web is just there...
uh
Hmmm scorpion corpse popsicle
Well people in this side eat pigs and rabbits and chickens and bee vomit
LOL





Kiku is humble, she cares for her friends deeply, she has a badass side and is an all out samurai bro
plus she cute
Both her masks are crazy cool
I'd like to see more of Sanji's recipes
He is in the beginning of a war and doesn't cook a make you go berserk and kill everyone meal? Hack
99
Well he has cooked
The cake and the meal after PH
Plus the soba
He used that in PH
No, two
The cream in the cake is one too
The Punk Hazard one was after the battle and it isn't filler, it's the Hormone Soup with Sea Pork. The cream in the cake is also not filler.
OHHHHH
> It just is a really cool concept especially when fighting a yonko crew to give them some sort of edge over them <@!521783526878609418> Yeah and the two we see have cool properties, the first rejuvenates you after a battle to regain your strength; the second is so sweet that people eating it can almost die
That's a cool ass bot
<@!521427565492305931>
> But the cake thing is literally just cake filling <@!521783526878609418> Nah, it's the absolute sweetness, it can take people out. Look at Bege
> Sanji dumping 46 bags of pure cane sugar is not a "secret recipe" <@!178106988687917056> Not what he did. There was a whole recipe. Just adding sugar doesn't help
> Yeah the cake thing kinda dumb tbh <@!521783526878609418> pls explain, when even Bege was almost taken out
The Newkama recipes are meant to be 99 all with different properties
> Something being so sweet to take someone out isn't a cool recipe that can physically enhance the crew to change the way a fight goes <@!521783526878609418> It can decrease enemy forces
> And if that didn't exist the arc wouldn't have gone any different at all Not the point
I'm talking about the recipe itself, not how Sanji used it
Oda could've made him work with more of the recipes for sure, but I hope many are like the cream, with interesting properties like that
> A MAN'S DREAM WILL NEVER END!! <@!734026065508433922> wrong
Sanji is as serious as he is goofy
Mr. Prince, in Wano when getting Toko, when he agrees with Zoro in leaving Usopp behind
Yeah that one was fucked up
!oda2
Yeah it's a cool part of him to me. But this one with BM was too much

> But going back to my question earlier, Will you guys like it if big mom became a friendly to luffy <@!547300083658522624> bm is kind of a monster, she has kidnapped and forced too many men to be her husbands, she takes lives like it's nothing. She is in Caesar levels of disgust. Unless she has a spiritual change and becomes a buddhist monk, I can't see her being friendly to anyone other than talking food
but this is general -cries-
> why can't i send pictures nooo <@!165987509858336769> You can. You just don't know how muahahahhahahahahahhaha <#522036834310815744>

> How did coby grew from being a kid to a teenager in 2 years <@!547300083658522624> In less than that, in some months. He was a teen post Ennies Lobby
BM should die
> She ATE her mom <@!734026065508433922> accident
> Big mom isn't that evil to need to die <@!346692838328893452> She kidnapped and forced her husbands to have children with her (sbs volume 90), she takes the lives of people who wanna leave...
Kidnapping several husbands and having children with them is not ignoring everything else
BM is evil, no way to deny it
Her child self could be sweet, sure, but she now does a lot of evil stuff deliberately as an adult
She kidnaps dozens of husbands and forces a pregnancy bro
Not enough to die, sure. But evil, extremely evil
> I'm just saying out of all the evil characters we've seen Big mom isn't even in top 5. <@!346692838328893452> She easily is. Tell who those 5 are
Caesar, Doffy, Kaido?
Evil - one who creates unnecessary suffering to others, being it only necessary if it means one's survival or health.
What does Holdem do?
Believe?
U mean Hody?
Holdem is quite nice in compariso
Who is creating the most suffering directly?
> "Yes I committed genocide, but it was *for a reason*" <@!171861037438599169> That's way more dangerous than the comically evil. I don't know which is more evil, but the one who can grow to power easier is the one who can invent reasons for the evil and is not seen as doing evil just because
Who is hurting more people is an easier question
Kaido creates more suffering, so he is more evil. That's an utilitarian way to see it
If the suffering is unnecessary to the one creating the suffering, what's the difference?
I agree, fats
The only thing one could think to make me justify the suffering is "I needed this to survive or maintain my health". Anything else is about actions and suffering created unnecessarily
If you do it crying or smiling makes no difference to your necessity of such suffering, nor does it make a difference to the victim
Appeals to nature are not moral justifications, they are fallacious arguments
> BM killed her mother, Doffy killed his father. Same action but is the evil the same? Intent matters just as much as actions. <@!521427565492305931> One is deliberated, the other isn't. Two deliberate actions make no difference, though. If you kill someone knowingly bc u hate them (Doffy), or because they aren't working well (CDs to slaves), then their intentions don't matter. It only matters that the action was deliberated, it was a decision. Big Mom had no decision on it, she wasn't a moral agent
Sure, I believe deliberately killing someone without need to (needs as in survival), then it is a morally evil action
> "Religion is the opium of the people"  - Mona Lisa (source: believe me bro)
> they pay with soul as tax but they get protection from the rest of the new world <@!228271420445163521> Only if they have the decision to just leave. Do they?
option*
If they can't leave Tottoland, then it's not making them a favor
If they can't leave, then it is wrong, because it is removing the decision from them

> like, can he slice kaido <@!547300083658522624> There's the haki situation. If Kaido's haki is strong enough, what will Oda cut?
> He was able to slice someone full clad in Haki (vergo) so I‚Äôd assume so <@!478681268532281347> bc his haki was stronger. Vergo was being dumb for using haki in all the body
Now that we know armament is something that flows and that advanced techniques are about making it flow to one spot, putting it in the whole body is dumb
I don't think haki would have anything to do. Foxy should be able to slow Kaido
But not forever so
<:CroShockoKid:680940244157333594>
> if foxy just uses the beam every 30 seconds, why can he not permanently slow down kaido? <@!171861037438599169> The time he'd use to reactivate the technique would be enough to Kaido fuck him up. Or if that's a stretch, imagine no one is there to deal damage to Kaido, how will Foxy get out of that situation?
> are you saying it takes more than 30 seconds to reactivate? <@!171861037438599169> No, that either Kaido uses the milisecs there, or that Foxy would have nowhere to run

Mihawk will start the Mihawk Pirates after saving Perona and Moria from BB
Nah the Mihawk Pirates seem cooler, there's the whole aesthetic

> yeh , i said afterwards , ' unless mihawk dies ' <@!328936254978916352> Mihawk becomes a weak old man. BOOM not only unless he dies
> most likely both zoro and mihawk will live Yeah their story has been pretty much set in stone, I think
But someone somehow removing his objective from the equation could also be interesting
> yeah , but you would still need to defeat mihawk Nah, if someone uses the "brain damage no mi", there'd be no Mihawk  to fight
> Interesting but infuriating yes, I don't see how Oda would make that work
He'd be already fucked up, there would be no value in killing him
Swordsman Grand Competition, √† la bad manga
Hmmm I don't see that happening. Luffy will just meet the Mihawk Pirates on the way
Then Mihawk will create the Mihawk Pirates, not join BB. BB are soooo out of the dracula aesthetic
> Halloween pirates with Mihawk, Moria, Perona, Hogback and Absalombie <@!283276421470748673> This is the only thing that makes sense

Izo and Kiku just have those good genetics
That just means your headcanon is at the level of Oda's, fats. Mine is above that

I'm not that sniperwolf person btw
> Coz that‚Äôs not true <@!474659436804177930> prove it
yes
Oh, I thought you had a reason to say that with so much certainty, like a grammar issue in the translation. But if it is "they couldn't use observation back then", then it really has little to no value
That is the point, you said that moment possibly implying BB being multiple people was "not true"
We can say that it isn't likely for those reasons, and that it was probably said to mention BB's crew and not himself, now dismissing the possibility due to some inexistence of evidence of them having the power to sense it is not valid
I'm not saying anything, I'm not even claiming anything. I'm saying lack of evidence is not enough to dismiss a possibility completely
The stretch is dismissing it as a possible interpretation because the other interpretation makes more sense. Yeah, the latter makes more sense, we can all agree I think, but saying the former is "not true" is claiming to know more than what we know
> That‚Äôs such a redundant thing to say. Obvious things without official confirmation can‚Äôt be claimed as wrong hurdur <@!474659436804177930> That's simple things in life bro. You can dismiss it as relevant, but you can't say it is "not true"
Then you're talking about your interpretation of it and not about factual claims, so idc
still your interpretation, so that's fine
> This is what annoys me. Bring something that can make the idea of ‚Äúit was referring to the crew‚Äù not sound like the only possibility. In stead of just saying ‚ÄúItS yOuR iNtErPrEtAtIoN‚Äù but technically not a fact. Coz I hate when the discussion can‚Äôt progress <@!474659436804177930> But that's what happens when we lack information. Your interpretation can be whatever and we can talk about it, explore it. However, we can do that without dismissing other possibilities as false. I also think it was about the crew, but if it is about the crew, then there's nothing left to say, is there?
I'm not saying he doesn't, it's a normal conversation
Doom is talking about the burden of proof. Sure, if you have evidence to falsify a hypothesis you can show it, but it is the burden of the one making the claim to show evidence for the claim. Claims without evidence can be dismissed without evidence
You have to define theory in this context
If it is anime type of theory, sure
But now we are talking about what makes theories solid and likely, and not about claims themselves
My BB theory is he doesn't sleep bc he's scared Ace might come to get him. Fucking loser
Marco
Polo
Orochi is known in the underworld as the fruit collector, for he has 8 fruits
Doom, don't attack me like that
Yeah, it's not a solid theory at all
Arabasta is not a place for smartasses
Well I only talked about you claiming it was wrong, I never said I didn't agree the theory is dumb
If it was, then that's it
> But do the same for others plz <@!474659436804177930> Who said the theory was "not true"?
He called it stupid, he didn't claim it was not a possibility in the first place
But it‚Äôs not interesting in the sense that Zoro said ‚Äúthey‚Äù which could imply they knew he was multiple people or whatever Coz that‚Äôs not true
You can see how another interpretation was you claiming it could not imply, which is explicitly what I was talking about. If you corrected me before and explained you meant it isn't interesting, then the conversation would've ended before
LOL that's just how I write, I guess.
U were the one saying we should do the same for Doom and Choc, I was explaining why I didn't
That's it. It's done
<:Uso:637751966184767546>
That was a brain explosion rn
BM just didn't know
Dumbass
BM was a dumbass, I mean
Sorry for being ambiguous
> Not actual strength <@!522829790076600364> you can see his arm getting pumped on the right
reread
U need to reread the panels bro
> clearly she just pumped their motivation to lift some weights, so offscreen that dude went and did 1000 bench presses before coming back <@!319767910098796544> Oh yes, of course
It shows a person getting his muscles all pumped lol
It's mental and physical
It's the perfect fruit for a revolutionairy
never claimed u were the only one
I came in in the middle of the convo
> <@!415999229564157955> tbh it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that she needs allys to use it on, can't see how it'd help herself if somebody attacks her <@!704581670921306153> She can be strong without devil fruit powers, look at Zoro, Sanji, Rayleigh, etc etc. The powers themselves are perfect to create revolution
coomie in the chat
Tell us other fruits good for revolution. The propaganda propaganda no mi? Nah, Belo Betty's is da best
> if anything, her devil fruit is a bit too convenient lmao <@!474659436804177930> Maybe it was due to her fruit that she decided she needed to use the power. Cause and effect ooohoohoo
It's Streusen being a chef with that fruit
Facxts
Lindbergh may be the only named mink, but he isn't the only named Revo furry
You wouldn't understand, Frost
Shanks being the most difficult to find was in the novel, wasn't it? Is that info canon tho?

She is old enough to be his stepmom so

"GANBARE MUGIWARA BOY"

WRONG

oops

looooooooooool
One Piece speedread for the maximum appreciation of the story
> <@!153273023456083969> no it implies that some of us understand liteature, while most casually look at pictures and surface meanings only <@!543991021793574922> You're not smart, bro
I've seen better trolls
ryuo is haki
Youss speedreads
It doesn't Talon
Reread
Speedreader detected
You can't even spell casuals
Speedreader, go reread that part
Show the panels u speedreader
He'll come back with the panel with Zoro cutting the coast line
WHERE IS THE PANEL
Show the panel dude
If you need to copy paste the wiki and can't show manga panels, u dum dum
Show us the panel
How can't u understand "show us the panel"
Someone so smart not knowing what "show the panel" means
Show the panel
LOL
Pffft "I can't even show a panel to back my dumb claims"
> ryou is special haki <@!699125747939278888> Wrong.
!ryuo
See, panels
Wow, panels, amazing
Smart literature connoisseur can't understand manga panels
> Enma does not enhance your Ryou <@!543991021793574922> No, it takes the haki from the user even if the user doesn't want to and therefore cuts more. The limit is still the user's haki from all we know
> What is Ryuo/haki? <@!543991021793574922> Did you not understand how armament haki flows? Hyogoro explains that
It takes more than needed, it doesn't enhance
LOL dude
You don't even understand basic manga literature
Enma makes the user use more of his haki compared to what the user intended, not compared to what the user previously could use. Reread
> <@!415999229564157955> using more haki=STRONGER HAKI <@!543991021793574922> But the limit is still what Zoro can use. So Zoro does not have more haki with Enma, dum dum
Haki does not last forever. So if a sword is taking more haki than what u want, your haki will drain and you'll get tired faster
Reread
> HE SAID IT HIMSELF <@!543991021793574922> He says that if he comes to a point where he can tame Enma, that means he is stronger
!flowchart
> So yall are really claiming Enma isnt a stronger sword <@!543991021793574922> You said it enhanced haki LOL. Enma is a tough sword to use, so the user needs to be strong, that's it
!oops
> <@!415999229564157955> It enhances Haki by drawing out more.  Haki is litearlly willpower..  having more willpower will always be stronger then using less lol...come on guys <@!543991021793574922> No because if the user can't tame the sword, it will take all of his haki and therefore he will be tired quickly. You know why Luffy's Gear 4 doesn't last forever, right? Reread
He is training with Enma exactly because Enma is tough to tame and takes too much haki, making u tired in battle unnecessarily. If you can tame the sword, it means you are tough enough to counter Enma's properties
LOL
Shitposting phase
Haki doesn't last forever dude
You saw what it did to Zoro's arm, he would be done if he couldn't tame Enma. Using more of your haki than needed is not necessarily an upgrade, it is actually a downgrade if you aren't strong enough to use the sword, that's why Zoro used it to get better
At least these dumb takes create an active chat
LOL
Foreshadowed lol
Show the panel where it is foreshadowed
Therefore?
If it was in the entire post TS, you can show at least some panels
Of the foreshadowing
> I dont have panels laying around <@!543991021793574922> Search for them
Makes claim, can't defend it. All that talk means zero then
Show us
That's not enough

Stahp this chat
muaaa
> why could wyper make enel tangible with sea stone?Sea stone is supposed to weaken not nulify dfs <@!703504844903940096> It can weaken to the state of not being able to use the powers. Didn't Smoker get traped in seastone cages more than once?
He can stretch if other people pull is body parts, isn't that so?
Well seastone and the ocean have a similar energy, that's why the marines use seastone under their ships when passing through the calm belt, as it confuses the sea kings, but they eventually find out
?
the salt?
!water
even rivers
could be idk
clouds, yes
Usopp couldn't use the cloud dial after Skypiea, but Nami now can using her bling bling weather science

I want to see a Franky battle against fodder when Zoro trusts Franky to cover him after Yasu's death
I like it better with bubbles

Stop this convo
Dude, go read some books
Stop
Everyone can rape people. Stop this conversation
<#456573949120217089> rule 2
That was the one advertising
I was also trying to stop a stupid convo, but it seems to be done
I'll just be here if someone wants to discuss smth he says
Do u know what Jobo and Bartolomeu have in common?
They were both seen urinating to a body of water publicly
Thanks for coming to daily facts
Hope so
Some characters that should have names don't too so it's a double edged sword
!chapterwait
Brook has the right answer tho
It's not two in a row tho
Wait is it?
986 to 987 wereq week apart
> I am not enjoying my time waiting <@!383464767421153290> Don't ever even try to speak to Lord Brook, who had to wait for decades, ever again
I don't want 3 chapters in a row. There, I said it
> <@!415999229564157955> Brook did not need to wait for the next One Piece chapter, though, just for human interaction and salvation and sunlight. Clearly we have it worse. <@!383464767421153290> And his best friend Laboon
3 chapters in a row means One Piece will be closer to ending
I don't want it to end
Also sooner two piece ends tho
sooner it ends
<:PepegaLuffy:595458349248675847>
Don't create dumb expectations and enjoy the ride
