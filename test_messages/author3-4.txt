one of my favorites, have fun
some people don't like it due to some "pacing" issues, but I generally hear good things overall
enjoy!
better than Luffy
<a:runningemote:735442727239417917>
something like that
oooh Archer sent me a friend request
probably coz of Berserk
idk

yeh because midnightz is here, don't mention any fruits or spoilers from WCI onward
don't wanna spoil them
I'd choose Sengoku's buddha fruit
oh and pickle
this channel only allows talk about things that have happened in the anime, so no manga spoilers
it's about a year behind
I sent a request to Pasta
see if he accepts
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>

<:Poggers:596503195816296511>
arigato
cya
no, more interested to see if you would accept
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
social experiment
I wonder if Adam would accept me
this guy called Adam
seems like a nice guy
yeh, he only talks to elite alpha chads
so I'm not surprised you don't know him
ah, I've seem to have stumbled upon <#164971940648321024> during shit meme hour

ye
they want me to simp for their favorite series
so depending on the mood
oh yeh I wonder which channel I've spoken in most
general or manga
ok definitely manga
yep
I hate to admit
you notice
that it became better when I joined
<a:runningemote:735442727239417917>
oh 100%
recently
coz fats typoed with Goy
<#164971940648321024> is either infuriating, educational, or memesical
no normal
<#513312224048185345> is how I met Pasto
talked about Ozark
now me and Pasto are brothers uwu
yeh music is just mainly people putting osts
which is cool
but I like it when Sab and Juba post stuff in music
just leech off of their taste
so I don't have to find it myself
NOOO
<:Uso:637751966184767546>
lol
I'm not the biggest fan of his music either. I just listen to it to try and broaden my "taste"
of for sure
oh
he's a very well rounded guy ngl
cya zfb
he knows a lot about everything somehow lmao
kinda like Doom
the SAO opening lady
and KnY
my brother is obsessed with her
LiSA got married recently I think fate
sorry bud
<:WapolTriggered:587621943725916180>
ADAMAS is my favorite of hers
haven't even watched that part of SAO lol
Berserk 176+ ||Is Miura a big Star Wars fan or something, coz this arc is called Falcon of the Millennium Empire. Kinda sounds like Millennium Falcon if you ask me <:LuffyThink:701983952482599032> ||
I know the problem
it's actually Choc
**EVERY TIME**, there's a stupid troll, you are here
jk
you attract them
ah so my deduction skills were correct.
<:bigbrain:690650741991276607>
#haikyuu when?
march 2016
I think
wasn't even born when this server was made
Is there anyone on here who has followed one piece since day 1
or at least like within the year it came out
that's still impressive
really
I've been reading since PH so I think 2011
marineford Choc?
lucky
you could take him
**SWEEP THE LEG**
I will
<a:aPES_Fight:652091181056000033>
I got Joe next on my list
I've decided
fuck Jojo idc anymore
I'll finish it eventually
yeh I've heard Joe is great
I only read one series at a time
GLT?
what is that
oh right
Red got me into Haikyuu
I'm the opposite
I'm not busy with life
so I gotta start the series
all of jojos?
the manga?
Sab read Haikyuu
Isn't Moe reading Haikyuu as well
or is he already finished?
<@!145193576165408769> have you finished Haikyuu?
Haikyuu is like on par with One Piece for me lmao
Haikyuu is amazing
I finished it in a couple of weeks
I think
gn
GTO was also in consideration for me, but people convinced me more towards Joe. So unless someone gives an amazing case for GTO, I'm gonna start Joe next
how many chapters is joe again? like 200?
yeh I'm just gonna do that Will
above is the greatest ost to exist
Ugh, I just feel like I'm missing something because I haven't read fucking Jojo's
idk
honestly
lmao
that may be so, but it just feels like Jojo's is a must read regardless of how good it is
but you have read it right?
I secretly feel I want to tho
it's whether it takes priority over other stuff
Finished Conviction arc last night for Berserk
<:ZoroNut:632474447462400010>
Berserk 176+ ||By the title of the arc, I'm assuming I'm gonna see a lot more of big daddy Griffith, aka the goat||
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
naisu
you I wrote a review for conviction earlier but I ran out of space and didn't get to talk about the ending lol
when Archer sees a rhetorical question, he makes torical
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
he was fine
Read Musashi instead
jk
I like Vagabond
like half of it
maybe not even
2 years ago
coz Musashi by Eiji Yoshikawa is my favorite book of all time
at least one of them
as someone who's worked in Barnes and Noble, I too don't remember seeing HxH in there
I didn't realize REAL was still ongoing
I thought it was over
yep
tbf, when I worked there
they were selling the color walks
so copped me a few of those
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>
lol Archer
the Berserk hardcover volumes on amazon
are like 40 bucks each
yeh I've heard that as well Will
so stupid
KnY is ass
Viri knows the struggle of being a twin
but I think she has another brother
whereas I only have my fuck nut of a twin
yes
but then again
that's not very hard
yeh
bro
<@126483707182710784> Star Wars spoilers I guess, not really
that's me and you
uh, my brother is older emood
gn
number 21, 6'10 center, Duke commit, EMOOOOOD
baba booey
die
how many members you got
ik, but what about the mha server
NANI
how
MHA sucks compared to One Piece
very random Ana
lmao
wooooow, so she gets her artist role back, but I can't get my sexy guy role back
jk
**IT'S A JOKE**
I'm reading Berserk
what's the best place to read Joe btw?
oh right
yeh
wait why does it say ch 111 is the last chapter on mangadex?
I thought you said there were like 170
ooooh
ok
ty
it's in my top 3
I think I prefer the foundation trilogy
if you're into sci-fi books I recommend that a lot
I'm sure
definitely read Dune first
it's a must
sci-fi isn't for everyone, but I don't know a single person who hasn't enjoyed Dune
and most of them don't care for sci-fi
oh bye emood
I'm too late
<:Crydo:586275183032270849>
yeh I know Dune loves Doom
wait
Doom loves Dune
lmao
oh is zfb leaving?
Bye zfb
<a:aWAHWavingBack:561303247512403980>
what's it about?
oh nice, guess I have to add that to the list as well
added planetes recently to my list, so I guess one day I might start a sci-fi manga binge
👽
k gonna have a shower then read Berserk
have a good one

I'm currently watching Gintama as well
but very slowly
if someone fervently recommends something to me, as in, it's their favorite series, I'll probably give it a try
2000 words Mai
yes choc
probably
if you truly believe it's a 10/10
I will eventually try and watch it
yeh as someone who hasn't read the manga, I love the movie lmao
well I didn't know what your 10/10s were
so if you have at as a 10/10 then I'll give it a try eventually
oh it's only 26 episodes Choc
I'll definitely give it a watch eventually
Silent Voice movie, ||yeh the grandma is one like 1 or 2 scenes then just dies lmao||
gn moe
I wonder if Caesar could diffuse through the barrier fruit?
oh yeh true
lol
<@!352259806985322506> I checked the logs, you started berserk on the 7th and finished on the 9th
<:ApooPoint:714023366356500531>
I tend to be the opposite
I definitely prefer manga and will choose manga over anime most of the time
really good
yeh at least 2 a day, but yesterday i watched like 4 I think
lemme check
ok, when I first started watching Gintama, I got to episode 50, but since I forgot everything I restarted, so rn, I'm on ep 35
yeppers
I'm glad they did that
I also don't like being confined to having to watch 20 minute installments structured by other people
I like reading at my own pace
if that makes sense
ngl
one piece kinda turned me off of anime
I don't really watch it anymore
like with Gintama
I've been told the anime is much better especially for appreciating the comedy
but for most series, I definitely would choose manga over anime
no
I'm probably not even going to when I eventually catch up to the anime
because I think they're animating the final part next year or something
iirc
lmao
yeh hopefully I'm caught up by january
but that's what I'm liking about Gintama
there's really no need to watch like 30 episodes straight
MHA latest manga chapter ||I'm really not enjoying this current arc that much. Kinda disappointing imo||
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
to answer your question
I sincerely hope no one is
jk
if you like it, that's cool
but I know a lot of people don't
I don't really care for shonen outside of One Piece a maybe a few others
explain that shit rn Zeph
or else
<:LULW:607641487429206106>
oof
> Nope. I just looked all this shit up <@!274366418223497217> that's a science in of itself. The science of making yourself sound smart by relaying smart people's knowledge.
is HxH your favorite shonen?
I see
ugh why aren't my berserk files loading
no
yeh, and for some reason the pages won't load
ok wait
they loaded
<:ok_Griff:452942412579471411>
I know you were all super worried
WAIT
HOLD UP
My arlong emote exists!!!!
<@!257978175647252480>
YOU DID IT
oh wait
it's from another serber
<a:GutsMegaCry:721314623495733288>
I'm Goy now
Berserk 180. ||Zodd vs Guts. Not a bad way to start a fucking arc lmao||
I like One Piece

Good morning
I love the iron balloon analogy for BM
“Base”
Even if it was extremely different, who tf cares
It was 500 chapters ago
Lmao
post Enies lobby was around 2005-06 iirc
Somewhere around there
Yes that chapter was released in 2006
By Koby san
<:KobySalute:647335491410067489>
<:CrocoDurr:663850964763279381>
I need to make one
To represent my inner alpha chad
Morning Fon
No
One piece will 100% not be ongoing for another 17 years
Not even 7 but I won’t get into that
Therefore you should believe them
They are superior fans
And have more comprehension to the story than us lowly plebs
I think Ohara face revealed
Morj pissed me off recently
No not because of that
Because he made a video saying that Kaido would not die, giving Mr. Earl of Gyoza this strange sense confidence boost for our bet
Lmao
Yeh
No
Lol
?
I believe he’s stopped smoking, or at least drastically reduced it
I think that was for a stretch of chapters/arc
Not all the time
During his breaks he spends a lot more time with family.
I believe they live in separate houses while he’s working
I may be wrong on that tho
The sad thing is fats, a lot of people are always like “mangaka would be a dream job”, but once you hit Oda’s level, the emotional and physical tole over the years is actually quite tragic
Wait
It’s a drawing?
I thought it was like a make your own trainer website or something f
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
Haikyuu is better
<a:runningemote:735442727239417917>
You should it’s better than one piece
<a:aPES_Laugh:664885767574781964>
Even if I were being serious, how does best selling = better
I’m getting a haircut on Friday
It’s a tragedy
<a:aPES_CryDrink:678210605781352448>
Luckily I was being facetious so ..
I’m tired of all these “you look homeless” comments
I’d like to grow it long at the back one day
But mine just grows everywhere
Hey
It’s constant rain and thunder here
So annoying
It’s hot during the day
But for some reason I’m the evening it’s thunderstorms recently
I just love Washington state man
I always think about moving back there someday
Good question
My sleep is all over the place atm
Oh and hey Viri!!
<@188565235609632770> get over here or else
<:PES_Sniper:667742302755749908>

No Viri never
Only go full bully on me
<:LUL:321931602655707136>

You watching this game?
Really?
Lmao
I dunno, he was better last year
That was a big steal by Dame
Berserk is pretty funny
Umm, bout to read some more, but I ||just finished Farney and Serpico’s flashback || Berserk 190
<@134857202446893056> !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What a game fuck me
Congrats
||I’m glad we’re getting more of her, coz Conviction definitely left a lot to be explored with her character|| Berserk 190
Crazy
Dame is an animal
Woah 154 points in last 3 games lmao
<@!373144491005313025> **Berserk 190** ||I like their backstory because it showed how dark the world in Berserk is from 2 polar opposite sides of society. Serpico was growing up in poverty and really just went through the motions of life. Didn't have ambition or hope, just looked after his mother and survived. I loved that scene where he's just lying in the snow, not even trying. Whereas Farnese, grew up in nobility and wealth, and yet is also suffering from isolation and lack of purpose. I love how them coming together "completed" each other in a sense.||
panicked lol
not clutch
<:LeBronFlex:596739222950641684>
||I'm glad about that, because during Conviction, on surface level, she was "dislikeable". That's why I was eager to learn more, because I could tell it was a lot deeper than what it seemed at first.|| Berserk 190
gonna keep reading, hopefully finish a couple more volumes tonight
nice
ping me when you're done

I got muted lol
I had to ask Juba to unmute me
the funniest thing was
Red asked me to dm a mod when I finished Haikyuu to be unmuted, but I DMed Juba before I finished
<:OrochiScheme:689398969716965428>

it's shit on paper
<:shutupretardstoptyping:736095674730414081>
Fairy Tail ending ||Lol the final battle against the blue dragon Acnogloe or whatever the fuck. Lasted like 2 chapters and just had Natsu power of friendship punch it ||
Natsu is shit
one of the worst protagonists ever
fats just unlocked a deep suppressed memory that I wish remained forgotten
I forgot about that
||they go to that island and then get blown up or something, then come back like 7 years later|| Fairy Tail
made no sense
oh

lmao
K I'm gonna go to sleep now
good night guys
So GoH any good?
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
Wasn’t planning on watching it anyway
Almost done with Jojos part 2
It’s 1000% referring to the crew
Marco had a reason to know about Teach
Same crew for decades
Luffy and Zoro just met the guy and didn’t have any type of haki then
How tf would they know if he had “many souls”
Or whatever people think
It’s referring to how dangerous the BB pirates will be
It’s referring to the crew
No mystery
It’s literally referring to the crew
Wdym and?
Yeh it’s interesting how they could tell how dangerous BB and his crew were back then
But it’s not interesting in the sense that Zoro said “they” which could imply they knew he was multiple people or whatever
Coz that’s not true
Really?
Stoopid, you believe they could sense multiple people from him back in Jaya?
I don’t even think that’s something a master in observation would be able to decipher lol, especially not pre ts Zoro and Luffy
Lmao
That’s not the point Stoopid
Intent and hostility is different from sensing whether a person has multiple souls or whatever
Especially since Zoro was the one to say if
I don’t think it’s even a matter of observation haki lmao
Exactly
Surely all the top tiers at MF
Would be able to sense it
Zoro and Luffy on jaya were literally referring to the BB crew
And how they are dangerous as a collective
What?
That’s not the reason
^
That’s such a redundant thing to say. Obvious things without official confirmation can’t be claimed as wrong hurdur
Like come on
Fine, if I say I’m 99% confident that it’s referring to the crew, but not 100% does that make you happy
Fine I’m 98% certain
This is what annoys me. Bring something that can make the idea of “it was referring to the crew” not sound like the only possibility. In stead of just saying “ItS yOuR iNtErPrEtAtIoN” but technically not a fact. Coz I hate when the discussion can’t progress
Idk It’s not eve 7 am and I need a coffee. Maybe then I’ll be more personable
<:sadge:728308757964128346>
OK but...
I think you all missed what I was trying to say in the first place
But w/e
You just took me saying my interpretation as me stating a fact and thereby denouncing yours. Which isn’t the case. This wasn’t the type of discussion where I was correcting a misinformed fact. It was a discussion of hypotheticals where I just gave my interpretation. I wasn’t calling you objectively incorrect, or myself objectively correct. I know I used hyperbole so sorry if it came off that way.
Cerberus fruit <a:PepePuke:654218964162838538>
Lol
Wdym
Will Burgess just get a fucking fruit already my god
<:SengokuPalm:701663557338529802>
I’m not even gonna
Lol
There is clear favouritism at play here and I don’t like it
<:Uso:637751966184767546>
Lol I claim an idea as almost “dumb” even tho I never said that. But the second Doom and Choc denounce it no one brings it up lmao
<:Uso:637751966184767546>
Favouritism
That was hyperbole anyway
But do the same for others plz
Me (as hyperbole)
But then Doom called it stupid as well
Never said anything
I’m too tired and hungry
Sorry bout this
I don’t really care ngl
That is what I was doing
And I didn’t call the idea not true
I was referring to the idea that Zoro and Luffy somehow had this special type of observation haki “not true” especially pre ts
It isn’t interesting lmao
So I was being honest
Stoopid. You don’t need to write a fucking essay each message just to denounce my “poor” choice words as this mighty sin I committed against the laws of discussion. Especially since this is over text. And it was quite an innocent discussion to begin with
Too early for that shit
Again. I think me using this emote <:Uso:637751966184767546> implied that it was facetious
Ok Jojos part 2 is much much better than part 1
Might actually make me continue the series lmao
If I watch Eva first, then can I watch Jojos Frost?
I don’t even know. You said “kills you” so I assumed that was in reference to me watching Jojos
I’m not really with it this morning
I assume you’re joking when you said “Kuro’s fruit”
That’s coz Kyros is the chaddiest of chads
Sorry for being mean part 1
You’re not very shit
You’re just shit
!rank
Oh you weren’t joking
All good tho, I’m retarded this morning as well
Wait Choc. Apparently the princess Tutu manga and anime are very different
It’s a win win situation
It’s clearly Buffy. He has orange hair. Luffy has black hair <:CrocoDurr:663850964763279381> <:shutupretardstoptyping:736095674730414081>
I wouldn’t worry about eventually getting Dragon info lol
It’s gonna happen
<@!145193576165408769> good luck with your presentation today
that is good to hear fon
one of my best friends in the world has pretty severe autism and he's one of the most interesting and kind people I know
if anything, her devil fruit is a bit too convenient lmao
jk
probably something like that Stoopid
I'm getting my haircut in an hour

<:ApooPoint:714023366356500531>
Wait brb
Lol at the barbers she was like “so what have you been doing for fun during quarantine”
And I was like, how can I say something that isn’t “I’ve been sitting on my fatass reading manga and using discord all day for the past 3 months”
So I just said “I’ve been going for runs”
<:LUL:321931602655707136>
I have mastered the art of bullshit
Had to make myself sound slightly respectable
Same
Lmao
So antisocial
Part of their training as well
I should make my own barbershop called “haircuts for antisocial weebs who don’t want to talk”
I would make millions
How many chapters is shaman king?
I know this may sound dumb, but is there anything that it’s “similar” to
Coz I have no idea what it’s about and I keep hearing about it

Let me scroll up
Garp low diffs Roger on a drizzly Tuesday
No
Break
is this about the storm during the ed war?
It was Scopper Gaban
mark my words
yes
Pasta <:Uso:637751966184767546>
Scopper is the shipwright of the Roger Pirates
more relevant than Luffy
lol what if he doesn't like it
that would be funny
oh right
didn't like his Thriller Bark review
yeh
the summit war saga is perfection so I can see why it keeps getting better for him
sabaody, Impel Down, and MF are all 10/10 arcs for me
so I get where he's coming from
Sabaody is definitely a 10, Impel Down may be a 9 but still close
does he know about Ace?
I don't really watch him too often
so idk
lol
based on his dislikes from Thriller Bark. There are things of Dressrosa that I don't think he'll like
but he might still like it as a whole
the nosebleed stuff in FMI might piss him off as well
yeh
he completely disregarded Moria's intent as a character yeh. Idk if he just didn't mention it in the script, but he focused **way **too much on his powers I agree
I think he overreacted to the Absalom stuff as well. I know it is weird for a lot of people, but not to the point where it detracts from the arc imo
as a whole
Dressrosa maybe  but there are aspects of Dressrosa I don't think he'll enjoy
I hope he likes WCI. I just don't want him to be super distracted by superficial "flaws" that become infinitely better after a reread or more consideration
I know it's meant to be his first read through
whatever people seem to complain about at first glance Kaz
Wano is gonna be better than WCI 100%
> arlong arc is the best arc :) <@!426750321893703683> **YES BOYS**. I found another
welcome to the Arlong gang
when Wano is done, and you can binge it. It will be amazing for sure
soon
Dressrosa is 10x as good now that you can binge it
it's far from perfect Illu
but I really disliked it weekly
hell
like, terrible
I haven't reread Thriller Bark in probably a good 2 years
goddam
need to reread it soon
lol didn't he apologize on twitter or something from ~~fan correction~~
aslkfj
and fuck now I have the hiccups
yeh Arsal
I get that it's his first read through and is meant to be his raw thoughts. But like, especially as the story gets grander in scale, he should really take more time to think over stuff
he's too weak
are you caught up?
YC, there is a guy in <#164970986284777473> I keep thinking is you, coz he's purple and has a capital Y and C in his name
