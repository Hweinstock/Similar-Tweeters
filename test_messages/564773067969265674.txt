Nah lower
‚ÄúBeat‚Äù
Some glory will go to big mom assuming kaido dies
> Katakuri pirates ftw <@!439770223944400896>  more like peros pirates
Why would the WG kill a yonkou
Both kaido and BM have plans to betray each other
It‚Äôs obvious
They‚Äôll use each other
No other reason
> yes they need eachother to beat luffy alliance so they cant betray <@617706789852545034>  what ?!! They don‚Äôt need help against the alliance lol
It‚Äôs that they need each other. It‚Äôs just that fighting over road poneglyphs will kill them both so they teamed up
No shanks has none
One in zou one with bm one with kaido (apparently)
Does shanks know where Rafael is ? I don‚Äôt think he went there tho
<@429648668648407040> actually he‚Äôs giving her that look because the word she uses to say ‚Äúslaughter‚Äù means beating someone repeatedly until they die
Yeah he‚Äôs over bm lol
Yeah
Mega hype
I doubt bb would show up. Maybe marines tho
Bb is looking for something remember
Saying if the wg won‚Äôt take it then he will
> I think one of the most frustrating things of being a OP fan is. Trying to get your friends to watch it <@429648668648407040>  unless you have no friend like me
People watch shows for the ending but op is a journey
Yeah could be pluton
Lots of ancient weapon mention lately
Bb is smart so he doesn‚Äôt need to fight much
Yeah he needs power to achieve his goals but he rarely fights himself
No idea lol
I think op has a good 7 years left
God valley movie would be amazing
Where does greenbull come in play tho
Yeah current pace is scary tbh
Anime is still fun tho
Anime and manga work together
Yeah manga first but anime is made for manga watchers hence the spoilers in openings
So both is good
Me too
Obviously manga is the main source for the story
Aren‚Äôt the main points the same in the anime. Except for fights
I still enjoyed dressrosa in the anime
Chopper footsteps sound great tho
> Why do i feel like Weevil will body Queen <@328936254978916352>  because he will
Wano faces have been great too
Am I the only one who doesn‚Äôt rewatch that much
I feel like khan is too much tbh
Anyone follows the one piece virgin
It‚Äôs a podcast
Nux and gang
Really good
I can never understand reactions
Only reviews make sense to me
> I don‚Äôt understand watching for the reactions <@!420202273885519872>  human nature and confirmation bias
Telling us gibberish but lots of fun
Brago and grandline are my go tos
Grandline is reasonable
Lol I‚Äôm the only Managua reader in my family tree
What a creepy about that
Tf is magu Chan
Bon voyage
Last few ops were fire
Zoro king‚Äôs haki thoughts
Me too. Lots of hints
It‚Äôs not vice captain stuff. Remember shabondy
Where did we see his full strength
> Sanji coc is possible because hes from royalty <@739154454871277668>  you understand the word ‚Äúking‚Äù wrong mah dude
Pica was 10 years ago lol
CBR is the best lol
Monet underrated wifu
> Top 10 one piece slice of life moments <@!460071803331674113>  you work for watchmojo bro
Hell yeah
I didn‚Äôt give a shit about ace dying
I was actually happy because it makes the story good
Merry was kinda sad
Toki talking to oden before the boiling was mega sad
I felt for luffy but I didn‚Äôt care about ace
Ace had to die tho
I understand why people cry about ace but I just didn‚Äôt care
Ace had potential
Luffy‚Äôs shock was great when ace died
No one‚Äôs hating lol
Just opinions
Ace was cool but didn‚Äôt do much
He was a device
WB‚Äôs crew was a family so they had no problem dying
Are colored chapters available as physical volumes
Damn
Using numbers of deaths as logic doesn‚Äôt work because they are willing to sacrifice themselves for each other
Yeah mega sulong hype
Shit I forgot about bepo
No he only got damaged because of oden ptsd
Btw does carrot wear a glove
Why the glove tho
Now way kanjuro is amazing
They were seconds way from war what‚Äôre you talking about
People can have their opinions lol it‚Äôs a discussion not a fight
Big brain kin
Anyone still doesn‚Äôt trust hiyori
The thing with ryuou is that it‚Äôs what wano people call advanced haki so maybe the haki users if wano are stronger in terms of haki
Bro it‚Äôs called ryuou not ryou I read the Japanese
> But you dont say Mantra for Future Sight either <@!283276421470748673>  maybe it is idk
Haki naming scheme is weird now
> 5th emperor was literally a chapter title <@328936254978916352>  what chapter was it
For the 5th yonkou thing. In Japanese it‚Äôs meant as the 5th in order not as part of a group. It says the 5th emperor not ‚Äúthe 5th four emperors‚Äù
Probably one of the roger crew still has it
They still had to come back from raftel
Where tf did sanji go btw
I‚Äôm still confused
He disappeared at the black Maria ‚Äúhouse‚Äù
Oden‚Äôs flashback is top tier
Franky is and lucky
She hella expensive
One piece power scalers are too much
> <@564773067969265674> u didnt see naruto power scalers then <@606196171307745308>  don‚Äôt remind me please
Swagkage talking about them is enough to know to stay away
Nah madara was fire
You better be
Duck one piece yeah
Kaido with his ptsd is weird
Hopefully it won‚Äôt lewd to his loss
Auto correct is the main one piece villain
Honestly saying op is mid is more triggering than sucks
This server is weird
Law is too innocent to be subjected to the straw hats
Why no oden emotes tho
> üç¢ <@272064319661801473>  mega funny dude
Oh shit yeah
Kidd
What‚Äôs your favorite op hentai
You into vanilla nah dude
Remember when he wrapped his neck around her
Nah she smart not a digger
She blackmailed vivi and others so she‚Äôs not very nice
She even blackmailed momo
> <@564773067969265674> she's like a coconut <@679552742343180331>harf to get into but nice inside
How tf did bb hurt shanks tho
> <@!564773067969265674> blackmailed how? <@272064319661801473>  not blackmailed but I forgot the word. She asked for money to help her
Why is Yamato‚Äôs gender even a debate
I know nami is nice I‚Äôm just kidding chill
You‚Äôre in discord
Angry chopper is too cute
Nami the capitalist
> pre ts at least <@703504844903940096>  tf is that supposed to mean
> <@564773067969265674> luffy is a communist <@679552742343180331>  nah he wants all the meat
> Pre timeskip chopper <@703504844903940096>  yeah ik but why is post ts not cute
Idk haven‚Äôt read about communism so I can‚Äôt say
Pre ts chopper looked homeless yet cute
Everything fails bc of greed and corruption tho
Yeah franky in choppers body made her mad
Pre ts robin is the best
Nah still is
She‚Äôs cute still but she felt human pre ts
It‚Äôs just robin jeez
She did pre ts too
Panda man was in law‚Äôs crew in one panel
Panda woman in Amazon Lilly too
What about when she was a kid
This debate is pointless
Robin us robin
Nah it‚Äôs just oden ptsd
They‚Äôre not that strong tho
There was a sub just for chopper porn but I forgot the name
> <@564773067969265674> Neko and Inu were able to stalemate Jack. They‚Äôre strong. Also, them all being Oden‚Äôs disciples? Their combined force to be equal to Oden makes perfect sense <@313446774628941824>  it‚Äôs mostly ryuou and I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre not strong just not that strong
Some people say that oden‚Äôs ryuou was trapped inside kaido‚Äôs scar
Pants are for the weak
> <@703504844903940096> Someone pointed out that each of their favorite foods was an ingredient that goes into Oden (the food), and that all of them combined created it. Each Scabbard has a sliver of Oden‚Äôs will/strength, so them combining forces to temporarily equal their master makes sense <@313446774628941824>  you‚Äôre too deep in the rabbit hole  bro
Theories are no fun imo just enjoy the story
I Stan croco mom
My favorite is that dragon isn‚Äôt luffy‚Äôs father
Who tf ships robin and luffy
I can‚Äôt see it
I ship brook and chopper
> <@564773067969265674> die <@!390543442335236127>  bro I burst out laughing thx
> choniki sounds retarded too <@!285327673553846272>  nah it‚Äôs hella cute
Carrot‚Äôs va sounds hella cute tho
> or i am assuming it got reduced , its not like i vist *those* sites <@690158729685106749>  yeah you don‚Äôt
Post enies lobby
She fucked up sanji after the bathhouse
What‚Äôs with the forehead
I still mistake Yamato‚Äôs face for nami
Female design is weird in op
What‚Äôs even that Island
Jeez I need to reread
Anyone think that brook and robin are awakened
Brook can leave his body tho
It‚Äôs lit called the soul fruit
Why would he need to do that
He has full control of his soul
That would be too op
Fuck ace
I think both robin and brook  are awakened since they got much more powerful after the ts
Peros wants to be captain so Marco can help stop big mom
> <@!564773067969265674> Luffy also got better at the properties of his fruit. I still see awakening as something else <@!415999229564157955>  brook can leave his body and just be a soul and robin can make another body. Luffy didn‚Äôt do anything this significant
Thatd s be cool
Gura gura king king gun
I still don‚Äôt know how akainu survived
What‚Äôs kalifa‚Äôs fruit called then
Is that the sound of bubbles in Japanese?
But akainu tanking whiteberad‚Äôs hit to the head is bs
> think it just means bubbles <@171861037438599169>  no shanon is bubble
Yeah cool tatts
> Awa (Ê≥°?) means "bubble" in Japanese. <@171861037438599169>  gimme a sec
> Awa (Ê≥°?) means "bubble" in Japanese. <@171861037438599169>  her fruit name is written in katakana. Awa means bubble or foam and shabon means soap bubble hence shabondy archipelago
I know I mean there two words for bubble chill bro
Oden didn‚Äôt fight kaido at the boiling because he knew it was futile and he had to wait 20 years for the prophecy. I think
Yeah kaido flashback hype
Couldn‚Äôt it just be that kaido wants to keep wano as his territory and oden threatened that so he executed him
I don‚Äôt remember kaido directly asking oden for info
Did we see that !
They paraphrase a lot tho
Bad grammar kills the mood for me
They were the best
Plot holes can still exist in op I mean look at haki pre ts
Why didn‚Äôt the 2nd commander of whitebeard know haki
Why didn‚Äôt he use it against bb
I doubt that oden told the scabbards anything about Raftel
> What's the point of using against BB? <@626378388264976385>  so he wouldn‚Äôt get beat up
If ace knew haki why did he lose to bb
Yeah but he gets more damage still so haki could‚Äôve helped
He just declared war dude
He‚Äôs a bit more reasonable
> ace might as well have been using haki vs bb , we just have no way of knowing <@690158729685106749>  I‚Äôm not looking for a debate but I‚Äôm not convinced by this plot line
Yamato reminds of old luffy big time
Bb is a monster yes. I want to learn more about him
Is it really that kaido has tough skin or does it have to do with king haki. Why is bm so indestructible then
We can‚Äôt get a backstory for every single one tho
I‚Äôm good with denjiro
Yeah it sucks
> this shit fucking sucks, take me back to naruto <@171861037438599169>  black zetsu flashback
I want op lightnovels to have movies
Everything goes back to ryuou in wano lol
Devil fruit mechanics help with power that‚Äôs why he lost to law
Op going sinen this arc
He gets a lot of screen time in the anime
When wb was stabbed by squardo why didn‚Äôt he have a scare in his back
<@!415999229564157955> I‚Äôm really in love with your kiku pic damn
He was a chad
Jack fought for 5 days with no sleep. Dude is underrated
Sulong neko and inu will be goood
Yamato us oden dah
Kin giving luffy some mad respect
Will shinoubu do anything
Zoro had his arc against big dick
Oh yeah wicked lol
> <@!698761447835959337> Oh u saying u don't remember Nami pretending to be ill and then stealing the boat and treasure from the three Buggy pirates that Zoro fought later, leaving them with a storm that made them shipwreck? LOL POSER <@!415999229564157955>  I don‚Äôt tbh
Yamato is just so lovable tho
Some ppl still think ace is Yamato‚Äôs brother and not that ace
Yamato‚Äôs personality is good enough for her to join imo
What about ulti is better than Yamato
What does ussop add then
You‚Äôre either a troll or a weirdo dude
It‚Äôs still too early to have the Yamato for nakama debate
> u did nopt tell me what Yamato brings because she brings nothing as of right now <@550837342517067786>  what did brook bring ?
> <@!564773067969265674> Brook had a direct to Laboon who the crew be friended on the way <@550837342517067786>  yeah but the crew doesn‚Äôt need him. That‚Äôs brook‚Äôs thing which doesn‚Äôt help luffy
Luffy wanted the zombies at thriller bark to join so
It‚Äôs luffy‚Äôs crew he does what he wants
I don‚Äôt even know why were having this debate. Yamato was just introduced and luffy can add whoever he wants
> <@!564773067969265674> Luffy said he wanted a musician and found one in Brook checkmate <@550837342517067786>  first it‚Äôs not a war dude. Second he wanted him to join when he first saw him because he thought brook was cool
> luffy had also been talking about recruiting a musician from the beginning <@95608189361336320>  but he didn‚Äôt know brook was one when he asked him to join right ?
> <@!564773067969265674> u join the brigade to attack me AND u jkust answered ur own question <@550837342517067786>  I‚Äôm not attacking you lol. How did I answer myself ?
> <@!564773067969265674> luffy invites anyone he finds amusing or cool, he loves strange things like an alive skeleton <@375397668727291911>  yeah he invited the zombies in thriller bark too but the crew stopped him so he doesn‚Äôt need a reason to recruit anyone
Can we stop this debate please it‚Äôs going nowhere
> Oh, sorry. This is my first time paying a visit to this server, so I am just following the flow. <@!711869066142416936>  relax bro discord is a shithole
Anything goes here
Op memes are sub par generally
Most memes are about how long one piece is
Yeah buggy d clown memes
They way ussop says condoriano is funny tho
Did sanji learn okama recipes btw
All VAs in op are great
A furry I see
It‚Äôs hella repetitive but funny sometimes
R/futanari is where it‚Äôs at
The message is nice but it‚Äôs kinda cringe  ngl
Oh god no
> Are one piece memes still a thing, though? I thought it was just a phase I used to have in middle school. <@!711869066142416936>  I still try to use haki to this day
Orochi is such a shithead but I still like him tho
I feel like no one respects the wg anyway
The low res and manga style combination is too much dude
They ded
Proud About what
It‚Äôs okay to be retarded
Jk
Btw
You‚Äôre welcome
I like kin but he‚Äôs not nakama material imo
I appreciate his respect for luffy tho
He will probably care for momo
Like a consultant or such
But kin seems to be really close with him
Yeah I can‚Äôt see a reason for him to join
I like how he loves sanji‚Äôs food tho
Yeah but stuff like pizza since they haven‚Äôt had it before is funny
Cmon not this agian
I really like amande‚Äôs design
Yamato is so lively she would be amazing
Bm has too many kids for me to care
If bm joins I‚Äôll be outta here
Who
Oh butter girl
Yeah I‚Äôm all for it
Yeah she got ngl
I really don‚Äôt like boa
Boa is not that hot bro
Chopper believing them was really funny
Will wano be as good as marineford
Alabasta is overhyped imo
Can‚Äôt I have an opinion
You‚Äôre mean dude
It‚Äôs my opinion of people‚Äôs opinion
Why would anyone want to be a marine
> ...save people <@690158729685106749>  yeah from the wg
One day
That‚Äôs even worse phrasing
> different standards <@690158729685106749>  thank you
I want to see more Bonney and Kidd they‚Äôre real pirates
> a backstory need not make you sympathise with a character , i didn't sympathise with big mom <@690158729685106749>  who hurt you
Nvm
Akainu should‚Äôve died wb fucked him up for real
He‚Äôs dedicated
What‚Äôs the difference
> Just annihilated some book worms <@550837342517067786>  please don‚Äôt start another debate let us chill bro. You‚Äôre a troll we get it
Akainu is just doing his job and damn he‚Äôs good at it
> he really has a one dimensional mindset . <@690158729685106749>  that‚Äôs what gives him character
Do the gorosei hold power actually?
> <@!564773067969265674> you are caught up on the reverie, yes? <@242843145501540363>  I know but can they do stuff or is it all imu
All marines are tools
I don‚Äôt think fleet admirals are full out puppets. They just choose the lesser evil
> Man c'mon how can people say he is a nice man I don't hate marines like smoker, aokiji, colby , tashigi etc but no matter what I cannot call killing people justice . And do you guys remember when colby talked to him he would have literally killed him if it wasn't for shanks <@741136344448761887>  well would you consider killing kaido justice
Villains are bad but they‚Äôre like spices. They make things interesting
> Not every Pirate gets executed, if that was the case they won't be needing Impel Down <@292376480426754048>  well impel down is worse because they‚Äôre tortured before executions
> <@564773067969265674> doesn't matter they still live through that <@292376480426754048>  what ? It‚Äôs basically a slow execution
Yeah but how many are there that could survive
Why doesn‚Äôt the wg kill doffy already
> someone please @ him on twitter that he needs to keep his expectations low reading post time skip one piece. > that ' no no no *this* arc is my favorite ' trend will be no more <@690158729685106749>  all of post ts is build up for wano that‚Äôs why it feels slow
How is all of pre ts build up for marineford
Yeah but mentioning bb isn‚Äôt build up
> it has all the major characters with take part in the war , and marinford is the climax to the whole ' morality of pirates vs marines which is good and which is bad ' , of course not every arc is *only* building up to that climax , same as post time skip\ <@690158729685106749>  well post ts only fishman isn‚Äôt build up but everything after is
> <@564773067969265674> explain how <@!198930928083402753>  I meant drum not Jaya
Explain please
Post ts law‚Äôs plan to take down kaido started at punk hazard then dressrosa was part of the plan. Zou brought the minks and raizo wci gave bm reason to go to wano so it‚Äôs all build up
Yes what
> You also have all these charchters that appear here and there every arc that we end up seeing in marineford , doflamingo , mihawk,  whitebeard , ace , kizaru , kuzan , sakazuki, etc , that's build up for MF <@!198930928083402753>  okay but just because we see a character it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs build up for the arc. It‚Äôs world building that helps tho. Marineford build up started with shanondy and you can say Jaya too because bb is introduced but skypia and thriller bark had nothing to do with marineford. Unlike post ts where everything is required for wano to work except fishman island if you don‚Äôt count jinbe and his story
Yeah law could‚Äôve taken Hawkins‚Äô heart back when he went to free bepo
> <@564773067969265674> thriller bark is the arc luffy notices ace vivre card WDYM? Not build up? <@!198930928083402753>  I‚Äôm not tryna argue here. I respect your opinion but it‚Äôs just how I see it
The problem is the difference in the definition of build up. That‚Äôs what I meant by opinion
Chill plz
Well it‚Äôs a discussion not a debate. You don‚Äôt need to change others‚Äô views rather see a different opinion
Do we know why bm and kaido are invulnerable
Well you can‚Äôt damage them mostly
Thick skin thing isn‚Äôt convincing
I heard theories about coc or high level armament
Fun fact : if a person has 40 pounds of fat in their belly then a bullet won‚Äôt get through so big mom is fat has some ground
Well we don‚Äôt know much about coc
I really hope that kaido doesn‚Äôt lose because of oden ptsd
Just like bm hunger
I hope so
Cheap wine is where it‚Äôs at
I‚Äôve seen people say that odens ryuou was trapped in kaido‚Äôs scar that‚Äôs why we see haki clash electricity since kaido didn‚Äôt use armament. What do y‚Äôall think
I love how quickly  topics switch here
Makes sense if she does
What‚Äôs the deal with asura tho is it real or a mirage
It was prolly pirates stopped by him in the gl who were happy
Yeah pirate image doesn‚Äôt help
But little did they know bb came to power
Footage of bb mastering the gura gura
Yeah really where is sanji at
No they‚Äôre just going to get shanks
Recent animation is fire
I just want op to reach 30th anniversary
I think he just feels it
That‚Äôs still and because mental trauma and stuff
Nothing will happen on 1000
Why would anything happen ?
Didn‚Äôt the admirals just use ryuou
What the admirals did us just like raighlay with the elephant
> Raighlay <@!283276421470748673>  whatever dude
How long have we been in wano so far
Damn almost two years
Two weeks till next chapter
WSJ break but three chapters afterwards
Two years almost
Yeah I was shocked to know too
I thought it was less than a year
Peros us gonna fight bm or kaido or both
> Dressrosa was 1 day <@!199878649426477056>  that‚Äôs why I love it
> We dont know if he joins Luffys side <@!283276421470748673>  he won‚Äôt join luffy he wants to be captain
He has lit 1 named attack dude
Can you feed a dead body a devil fruit <:TamaThink:740778292159709304>
Birdcage too op tho
What was the cage made of anyways
Didn‚Äôt luffy break doffy‚Äôs strings and couldn‚Äôt law have cut the cage with his def
If kin knew advanced armament couldn‚Äôt he have cut it still
There‚Äôs your proof of how powerscaling in op is bs
Yeah plot stuff too
I love how doffy is so chillaxed all the time
> <@564773067969265674> not when talking with law üòè <@!199878649426477056>  law is special to him
> He only had to be outside the birdcage and no one could touch him <@371317614821244929>  big brain time
Ace making hats for oars jr was too sad
Why did they want Moria dead anyway
No one respects Moria
Yeah kaido fucked up moria
If Moria steals kaido‚Äôs shadow and eats it can he beat bm
Let them Rest In Peace bro
> Moria will force Luffy to fight Zombie Ace <@!393767426526806027>  would be cool to see but I doubt it
Luffy would be livid
Yeah but they would be weak
Can zombies eat dfs tho
Yeah but he can‚Äôt get strong shadows
A lot actually
There‚Äôs a sketch somewhere with names
https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Roger_Pirates
Here see a lot
Your taste is shit then
Ok
<@328936254978916352> I was just kidding bro hope it‚Äôs okay
> <@!564773067969265674> <:ShanksWeird:638104331572215821> no bro , i am very offended , apologize 5 times in a row <@328936254978916352>  nah fuck you
Did the mountain bandits have bounties
That fall was weird dude
The impact was huge from that fall. Why tho
Not even tekking know this shit
Why seven legs on each side and not eat tf
Madoka right
Tell us the list bro
Could be worse
They feed if the debates
Is that HxH vacuum girl
Bro imma choke from laughing
Voice acting in op is top tier
Robin screaming I want to live wasn‚Äôt that impactful for me but when she held to the pavement with her teeth a piece of me died
> "Death is not an apology!" <@!114296407816404992>  damn the memories bro
Toki talking to oden before the boiling and knowing he will die yet she still  tells him he won‚Äôt was mega sad
Brook should‚Äôve died from all the trauma before the poiso.
Yeah he knows the value of people and friends
Calling her hound lady lol
Brook is amazing man
He is actually older than bm
After enies lobby she is
Zoro is still afraid of stairs
Chopper‚Äôs flashback was the saddest for me
They all have issues lol
Nah fuck it I wanna be sad
Kaido gives you free booze at least
Zoro flashback doesn‚Äôt count
Robin and chopper backstories are really similar
They were both outcasts
And so was chopper for his nose
And hiluluk loved him
Hiluluk drinking the soup was mega sad
Still waiting for zoro full flashback tho
Is zoro confirmed shimotsuki
Yeah me too
It‚Äôs not bc sanji got one but because we still don‚Äôt know much
Why tho sanji wci flashback was great
> <@!564773067969265674> because he is not like sanji <@509083474955599874>  do you mean the exact same story or a flashback in general
How is it realistic? Only unborn children die from stairs
> you can die from stairs <@509083474955599874>  I fell from the top of high stairs in second grade right on my face and I‚Äôm still here
> Plus, "falling down the stairs" might also mean "suicide", it's an expression in japan iirc <@!415999229564157955>  this was debunked, I think
How tf do you die from stairs <:WBeardWhat:638862189771620372>
> <@!564773067969265674> Anecdotal evidence is not good evidence. Thousands die from falling from stairs. It's how you fall and what may have been damaged. Don't just mock victims by saying only "unborn children" die from stairs. <@!415999229564157955>  if you die from stairs then you deserve it bc you weak
How tf does stairs kill people tho
Ok I give up dude
> he's part of the buggy pirates... that says a lot about him <@573221936809902080>  true
I‚Äôm only 4 years old at heart
> Malicious ignorance, even, saying some people deserve to die <@!415999229564157955>  so hitler didn‚Äôt
Bro this is killing me
I‚Äôm starting to feel that you‚Äôre serious bro
If you‚Äôre serious then I was just joking bro and if you‚Äôre still  joking then you got me good
Yeah sure
Anyways does rubber float
Not all warlords are same strength tho
Look at Moria
She ain‚Äôt that strong if can avoid her fruit
She can only turn people to stone
> <@564773067969265674> only <@606196171307745308>  yeah either mero mero mero or kicking them what else can she do for real
I might have forgotten
> <@!564773067969265674> this is wrong <@!372464153480134666>  please tell me how I‚Äôd love to know
All her attacks turn people to stone tajari what I was saying
So if coby can avoid being affected by her fruit shouldn‚Äôt he be good theoretically
Momonga did it
Yeah so it‚Äôs possible
I‚Äôm not saying he will def defeat her tho
Don‚Äôt get me wrong
Hurting yourself might not be the only way
This is all theoretical that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called speculation
Does haki help against her kids
Yeah so if coby has good enough haki he can hold his own then
I‚Äôm not sure about her haki level tbh
I‚Äôm not tryna say he will def win
Just an idea
Yeah she should have armament
But it‚Äôs a huge stretch to say that he‚Äôll def lose too
Do you really believe that coby is that weak
He might not win but he has a low-fat chance at least
If it comes down to haki I don‚Äôt think coby will be one shotted
Is he not really
If he‚Äôs not confirmed for armament then I stand corrected
If koby sees luffy‚Äôs face in Amazon Lilly he might have a change of heart lol
> <@!564773067969265674> "I can't win this fight. I'm sorry.. Garp-san" <@!415999229564157955>  garp will surely understand
Is Yamato taller than brook tho
Yamato seems like she would show him
Why would they want to capture the warlords tho ? They have the worst gen running around and most warlords keep to them selves
It might be to show the power of the ssg
DBF was fun as a one off thing but using it seriously would be lame imo
Did we learn doffy‚Äôs bounty when he was captured or nah
> 340 million was Doffys bounty <@!283276421470748673>  really ? Seems low
Doffy is a huge threat 340 is too low for the info he holds
Did they freeze doffy‚Äôs bounty before he blackmailed them
> <@564773067969265674> No one knew he was Joker, dude <@!274366418223497217>  but they shoulda still known about his status
If human fruit is zoan plants should be too. I think
Yeah but in the op context it should be zoan since they‚Äôre living creatures
Logia or paramicia won‚Äôt make sense
But Hawkins doesn‚Äôt turn to straw
It‚Äôs ryuu
Didn‚Äôt it use to be each arc
But then arcs got long
It would be crazy if kin betrayed the group
Isn‚Äôt hajrudin the giant from dressrosa
Buggy was born with clown nose lol
His make up was green at some point but it isn‚Äôt now right ?
Bots have feelings you know
What happened to captains John treasure ? Did buggy find it
It has to be weird every once in a while
Ace is only cool in fan arts
That‚Äôs too much even for me
Damn that‚Äôs cool
Alvida is Yamato they use the same weapon boom
Pink or purple is best I‚Äôve seen
That‚Äôs creepy
Jeez
Yamato has aesthetic
That‚Äôs cool
Wouldn‚Äôt say master
Kaido called it ryuou last chapter so it‚Äôs kinda weird
Kaido is fodder dude
No please
> i feel like ryuu is just easier for non japanese speakers because ryu is like a common word u see in games and anime, and ryuuou just looks weird in english but thats what it is <@!145742024803352576>  ryuu means dragon and in Japanese the wano haki is called ryuou but it‚Äôs better to use whatts easier
Seems like it
> <@!564773067969265674> i mean we all know what  we talking about when we say ryuu haki <@!145742024803352576>  yeah exactly but people hang onto stuff
Black Maria might avoid conflict
Damn boy
Oof
It will probably be orochi color
Viz makes all laughs the same
It‚Äôs really dumb
Bro I‚Äôve legit been here for 10 hours
I need to get a life
Yeah 14 hours my ass
Bro some VAs died and op is till going
Zoro‚Äôs va is awesome
> I mean who died <@581522752712867850>  roger and I think kizaru too
Others died too
Black bread‚Äôs va is cool too
Iconic
Otsuru and denjiro designs are great
Same
I like the name kyoshiro better
It was a wig all along tho
Server is dead nice
Yeah that‚Äôs me lol
Btw when you write my name it feels creepy
Idk why lol
It‚Äôs genuinely creepy dude
I don‚Äôt think so
When it‚Äôs a tag it‚Äôs fine but when someone makes the effort to write it it feels weird
Why did I tell you guys oh god
That opening sucked
Old openings and last few are the best imo
The ones in between were mid
> Bon Voyage so nice <@!145742024803352576>  someone gets it
Yeah hope is dope
That was good too
I miss old one piece
Good night bro
Op is all filler bro
Such bs
Nah it‚Äôs just the weird part of the server
Is katakuri‚Äôs mochi edible
Getting too weird
I don‚Äôt find anyone boring tbh
Cmon robin hating franky in choppers body isn‚Äôt boring
Females in wano have been great so far
Not hiyori tho
I still don‚Äôt trust hiyori
> yeh , robin has those moments once in a while , but overall i find her personality very bland ,not helped by the lack of focus oda puts on her<@!564773067969265674> <@328936254978916352>  true she doesn‚Äôt get much screen time
Can we get a good topic please
Art is great lately too
I want worst gen to make moves
> discord is so buggy for me I‚Äôm like minutes behind my bad if I‚Äôm late on topics <@!521427565492305931>  it doesn‚Äôt matter dude there ain‚Äôt no topics anymore
I wanna see more Bonney and Kidd
Yeah she was at reverie
I stopped caring about shanks tbh
We don‚Äôt see enough for me to care
Shanks is only theories
> mihawk is one cm shorter than shanks <@328936254978916352>  shanks > mihawk confirmed by canon evidence
Zeph is your nami pic from a spread
That was a good spread
One punch is the shit
Especially the webcomic
> <@!564773067969265674> <@!145742024803352576>  not cool bro
> neither for opm or mob <@301180109275136000>  I don‚Äôt think mob has a webcomic
Hyo flexing next episode
Yeah weirdos do
Why does he need to coat his face for haki spit tho
You one of those who write colour instead of color www
Trashkey
Boa only slave that matters
> do you think kaku has a square dick <@217616268088442882>  you mean cube
Big brain
> Usopps nose is probably bigger than-let‚Äôs change topics <@!521427565492305931>  please continue
Smiles are dumb btw
You guys have lives
> I don‚Äôt want to say anything bad about kishinoto bc I don‚Äôt want to start !os but just know I find that statement abhorrent <@!521427565492305931>  I even forgot the story dude. Shits wack
Togashi has nice art tho
Nah that‚Äôs too good
<:OrochiLaugh:632823459541680138>
Tama is so cute
It‚Äôs been a nice journey so it doesn‚Äôt matter what the op is tbh
Night
Doppio is that you
You win nothing
That‚Äôs actually a pretty good joke
Just say it it‚Äôs better than silence
True
There‚Äôs art of everything
Best art
Bc mods are lame
He says it would be dangerous here or smth
Archer reference hell yeah
Can‚Äôt wait for Kaido backstory
Does my doujin count as fan art
What do you guys think happened to toki. Is she dead
Love it
Novels are Canon tho right
> so how do you explain the similarities between tama and yamato ? <@328936254978916352>  shitty female design
I mean faces and such
Yamato looks great but I still mistake her face for nami
It‚Äôs just my experience
Otherwise I stab Yamato
Is it bad that I laughed
What‚Äôs the time elapsed in the story so far
Did oda confirm or is it just estimates
> <@!564773067969265674> Oda confirmed the measurements in SBS. We have pre ts and post. MF is crazy <@!415999229564157955>  bro I meant the time not measurements. Chillax
You seem to be really into measurements
Who else
Violet in the anime was the worst
She was inhumane even by op standards

Tf is this
That‚Äôs legit funny
Ussop‚Äôs face tho
Fun fact ; age of consent in Japan used to be 14
Maybe still us
Japan is weird
Sanji especially can‚Äôt forget her
Zoro > sanji
Oof
> Also bc she is 1/4 mermaid <@!415999229564157955>  that‚Äôs not how genetics work. I think
> <@!564773067969265674> Oda said she is 1/4 mermaid, nothing I can do about that <@!415999229564157955>  oh sorry carry on
Still confused about trebol
Is he even human
Lao G was the best tho
Strong world pushed nami hard
Both
The good days
Tb was fun
Brook backstory too
Big brain
Chopper man and luffy oyabun were amazing
It‚Äôs getting too weird guys
Shanks helped Moria move tb with his space time fruit
Moria got thrown around by everyone all his career
Which one had the day shift in zou
Did they make amends
Damn I need to reread zou
Bepo sulong hype
Is Moria human
What kind of human is that
Why does Moria look like a bowling pin tho
And they fell to his thighs
True
I‚Äôm just too insecure
Don‚Äôt remind me of my pain bro
Who cares about Moria
Why
Weird but ok
I agree but I don‚Äôt wanna see him anymore
True
He was interesting but not for long
I might need to reread to check him out agian
You got some good points tho
I stand somewhat corrected
I love the arc but Moria not so much
Manga is always better unless there‚Äôs music involved
His voice was fitting tho
TB is underrated
Which is perfect for his personal
We need more straw hat interactions
Absolom was cool but mega creep
Lit predator
Doffy is way better than Moria
But Moria has his place in the world
Imagine Moria eating bb shadow
I doubt he could do it
We‚Äôre Moria and kaido equal ??
Man topics sure change quickly here
Ulti using a mace is hella cool
Kaido‚Äôs fodder really be dumb
Who
Not helping bro
Tf is that
Lit never seen him before
How many names characters are there
Wow that‚Äôs a lot
Last I heard was 800
How did buggy swallow that thing
I‚Äôm choking from here
Luffy wining that fight was bs fight me
Yeah
Still don‚Äôt him but keep trying
How would that work
I have to know
> He probably went insidw and m*sterbated there <@450928710661701633>  reminds me of a shirahoshi doujin
Jeez chill guys
Yeah please
Nothing
Marines will take advantage for sure
That‚Äôs why drake is there
Calm down king
She‚Äôs too op already
A df would be a nerf
Imagine a penguin df
Oof
Yet a sloth smile
> have you all ever thought ab how much time we waste on here <@738998014039031888>  do you have anything better to do
Thai fandom really loves scopper gaban and the egg
Is big news awakened
Damage
Did robin actually find info in the alabasta poneglyph
About aw
Was it pluton
Damn luffy has a good crew
Franky probably read the plans too
But he‚Äôs valuable now
Wg should increase robin and franky bounty
What do you wanna with it
Who‚Äôs the shadow following jinbe and robin tho
I wanna see kuzan
I have feeling robin and jinbe will be captured
Bb won‚Äôt show up marines might tho
This server isn‚Äôt as much fun when actually discussing op lol
Why did you guys stop ? Cmon entertain me
Damn
Only the weak go to general
Btw who tf goes to also manga and why
I actually like Sakura
Damn snitches
Is that a threat <:TamaHuh:735289165109002260>
I can‚Äôt stop I‚Äôve been plagued
For real sorry tho
I was kidding bro chill
Why doesn‚Äôt anyone get my dry humor
I‚Äôve ordered 96 and 95 in Japanese
That‚Äôs fair
Importing from Japan cost me 20 per
I think volumes in Japan are 440 yen which is 4 bucks or less
No it‚Äôs official
I checked the shueisha website
I actually bought the digital for the same price
Btw doom I‚Äôm not tryna shit post but  I‚Äôve just been here for 13 hours straight and starting to los my shit
Insomnia bro
Haven‚Äôt slept in two days
I have no life lol
What about YouTube
My insomnia is doesn‚Äôt go away especially lately
It‚Äôs just my anxiety. Sorry for being a downer continue your conversations I‚Äôll just watch
Yamato
Carrot can be used for soup
Peros wants to be captain dude
He outright said it
Reject dial
They‚Äôre useless now
Tf follows cbr
Grandline had a video about them
Does anyone follow th op virgin
Op virgin is a ooo good
Nah glr is reasonable
How
Yeah
He criticized the reasoning behind their claims and not the characters
Did you see the follow up video
The point of the vid was current real candidates
He established a base for discussion
The. He made his own video
You can‚Äôt stop all pirates
The list is ok depending on the standards you want to use
I understand what you‚Äôre saying but he‚Äôs not an elitist
She prolly could
Are you the real shanks
Dude can‚Äôt even kill himeself lol
Nah it‚Äôs just ptsd dude
Have faith in kaido
Cbr had weird logic. CBR : luffy can beat kaido bc he‚Äôs the main character
A lot of the people in their list had the same weird logic so that‚Äôs what glr Criticized them. then he made his own list with the same handicaps he used when judging cbr. Dude is not an elitist even if you don‚Äôt like his list.
Joy boy‚Äôs review sare fun but his theories are wired
It‚Äôs your opinion vegito and I respect it
Ohara is nice tho
Bargo reviews are good too
Morj is god tier
His voice is nice
And he‚Äôs reasonable with his theories
Better than joyboy at least
Joyboy lost his shit
Tekking
Joyboy has decent reviews
Yeah tekking looooves carrot too much
Brago has nice reviews but his sketches are weird lately
Tekking is 28
I watch his streams
He‚Äôs looking to move out from his mom‚Äôs soon
He‚Äôs tooo much dude
Dollar store
Yeah he‚Äôs buying a house soon
Good for him
He‚Äôs dedicated
Yeah 500k
Rogerbase had a weird video with a nami and robin cosplayers
Too much sexual tension
It was sooo weird dude
Tekking works really hard
Lots of videos every eeek
Yeah but I don‚Äôt see him perving so it‚Äôs good
Tekking is like sitting with your friend and talking about one piece
Cosy
Well I have no friends so tekking helps
Top 21 boobs in op
Seeing marineford with all the VAs and music is really good
Some of it
How was that dude still alive and fighting
Damn
Fair enough
Kin is the one and only strategist
Luffy is def maturing
Seeing Yamato next to him reminds me of old luffy
Would be funny if kin pulls a black zetsu
Yeah funny cuz I‚Äôll drop op
Croco boy in wano would be cool
I don‚Äôt think he did
It‚Äôs just his df power
Yeah because he pulls the water out
He could dry up living things too
Remember when dried luffy up
He might be awakened still
!goda
Buggy‚Äôs fruit is actually pretty cool
He can fly even
But if someone varies his feet he can fly forever
Like in the panel
Im starting to feel like buggy is the real pk
Did he find captain john‚Äôs treasure
Yasoop
His fruit is really good
Bara bara would be great with someone competent
Keyword kinda
I don‚Äôt think he dodged it. It seems like kizaru aimed for his collar intentionally
Kizaru obviously has good aim so he couldn‚Äôt have missed like that
The falling in the water thing makes sense
<:ShanksEvil:544295530893672463>
Why
The whole student thing doesn‚Äôt hold much value apparently
Except for kuzan
I think all were
We need to remember that admirals have a job to do so even garp didn‚Äôt stop luffy
Do we know when they got genie df
Fuji has good control for a new user
Wasn‚Äôt he a friend of akainu
I have a question. Can haki block boa‚Äôs stone attack effects
It‚Äôs part of her df tho
So it should block it
Anyway how strong is boa‚Äôs haki
Don‚Äôt all her attacks turn people to stone
Smoker has sea prism on the tip only
Yeah but how strong is her armament
Do we know
What
Why does she have to
Wait where do we see marigold use it
Wtf
Anyone has the panel
Damn I really don‚Äôt remember that
Which one is it guys
Lmao
Is this supposed Robbie ryuou
Power went out
How is that ryuou
It seems like regular armament but he was deflected due to basic logic
I don‚Äôt see it tbh
Was there really a call back
I‚Äôm dumb
Damn I stand correct haaard dude
Boa is way stronger than I thought
Big oof dude
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
So koby has basically no chance
Just ignore him guys
Or call a mod
It‚Äôs bait
I really thought coby could fight boa a little tho
I was sleeping on boa hard all this time
Yeah koby fell for Rebecca
Who do you guys think has a chance against boa
Other than luffy and Fuji
Queen has no chance lmao
Minks aren‚Äôt attracted to humans right
Yeah bepo wanted to see a female bear in Amazon Lilly so they are probably not
Panda woman is too beautiful
Are there levels to coc
It‚Äôs basically just how strong someone‚Äôs will us
There‚Äôs probably more to coc
We‚Äôll see more coc probably just like other haki
> <@!564773067969265674> What we know now: > - Bang bang bangs weak af mfs that wouldn't even be worth fighting > - Skilled playas can pick who they choose to spare > - A skilled playa could fuck a cool boat <@!415999229564157955>  yeah but there should be levels just like armament and observation right
Neko mega savage
Next chapter will be goood
Pedro woulda looked cool in sulong
He‚Äôs too cool already
I‚Äôd rather lose Botha leg and n arm
Pedro is cool but I like him mostly because if his sacrifice
I‚Äôm loving the cover story
Oda is a troll
Yeah bc it‚Äôs hilarious
Poor pound no one likes him
I‚Äôd take the shirts shanks cosplay
Losing an arm looks cooler too
Pedro will of p
Is that hiyori from this episode
Current
Hiyori > boa
Yeah I think
I‚Äôm still not sure about the hiyori toki situation
Toei wants to attract horny teens so it makes sense
I‚Äôm okay with the aura
H> Horny teens like women with no digestive organs? <@703504844903940096>  honey teens don‚Äôt care about digestive organs
Boa‚Äôs face in the anime was weird in impel down
I loved op in elementary school. Saw baratie on tv
Two years ago I really got into it
Arlong crushing a canon ball with his mouth was so good especially as a kid
I actually dialed math bc I was catching up with op
Tf is that lady
The only time I failed was in 9th grade history
Op being long is the best part
My brother says op is dumb
Sad noises
People used to 24 ep animes won‚Äôt watch op
Three eyes are beautiful how dare you
I‚Äôd genuinely like a girl with three eyes like pudding
Been over a year
Who doesn‚Äôt find this pretty

Best girl
Fight me
Baratie and arlong park were top tier
I love you vain
Big brain stoopid
Wdym it‚Äôs better to learn about characters
That‚Äôs your problem not oda‚Äôs
Jk
Why wouldn‚Äôt you care about other characters
Like who
But it‚Äôs not like we get a detailed backstory for every character tho
Those side ones serve the purpose of world building
Stop
How do they make the act too long if they‚Äôre side characters
That‚Äôs not a reason
Lamp
You guys all worried about college and shit while I just take a gap year
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
A year after highscool where you don‚Äôt go to college
I need a break dude
I like learning but fuck school
I was the bully <:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
Just a joke gaben
Bro I lived in three countries so far it‚Äôs hard
Nah
I wanna go there tho
Yeah I speak five languages
Technically 7
I‚Äôm tryna get a scholarship in Japan now
For next year
That‚Äôs the best compliment I ever got
Thx gaben

Wow time zones exist

<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>

Big brain time

Muslims
You can have 4 then
> <@564773067969265674> if ur wife accept it but who does <@606196171307745308>  no I think the wife can‚Äôt object
She can‚Äôt even get divorced if he treats her well

All Muslims in Muslim countries can
Bro take it from me they can
Whits a peaceful discussion
But ok
Idk
Beats me
Prolly not
We need more op odaaaa
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
What‚Äôs the point of powerscaling ? seriously
I‚Äôve been lurking
Don‚Äôt fall for it vegito
Oh no
Guys chill please
Doom vegito take it easy guys
I need to reread
Can a coc users stop the seakings tho
A lot of people are more powerful than I remember
That‚Äôs be worse
And the earth with them
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
You sound like akainu king
You‚Äôre the most necessary sacrifice
What a  big brain discussion
Hi tanu
Please save us
Sup
Mine works fine
Don‚Äôt be in denial
King
Stop lying king
That‚Äôs garou I thought it was rayligh
Shinonu should do it
She hasn‚Äôt done shit so far
Why the hell was the impact of kaido falling so big
Yeah but it looked like he was King Kong gunned

Look at this shit
Tf is this
They can‚Äôt be that strong
Yeah 10k meters is the same as a few floors
Wdym he‚Äôs already cool
Or his beautiful mane
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
We just need kaido‚Äôs height width and bf percentage to calculate his weight
Yeah she thinned up
Somehow
Kaido always says he‚Äôs sober after getting hurt tho...
What
They said the raid will be in a full moon two years ago bro
> Kaido wasn't hurt after Luffy's "beating" <@!407999944675295265>  semantics
Gifters have no chance
Smile users look dumb and are weak. What‚Äôs wrong with kaido
Is he that desperate
Not cool bro
Wasn‚Äôt bear guy in the background in the manga
Kyoshiro is denjiro was too obvious
Not cool oda
Still don‚Äôt believe komurasaki is hiyori tho
I don‚Äôt know what to think tbh just a gut feeling
Kamazo was dope
> <@!564773067969265674> wtf <@690158729685106749>  gut feeling bro
There more to her
The toki stuff is still weird
So I‚Äôm not sure
I‚Äôm a dumby dumb dumb tho
It all seems to simple rn
Queen music is so good
Imagine paying for gifs lol
What‚Äôs with his chin
Jango right
Don‚Äôt ruin doffy for me
Doffy‚Äôs pants too tight got walking like that oof
Are the og bbp capable ?
Doki doki
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
It‚Äôs better not to know
Is that An afrobull pp tanu
Is your photo an afrobull art
Oh shit nvm
Similar art style
Guys we all know that hikari e is the best
> I have lost 90 lb in the last year <@242843145501540363>  damn boy good for you
Is it cheaper
Seen worse tbh
I‚Äôve seen brown hair Yamato and it‚Äôs worse
Wtf is happening here
I leave for 5 minutes
Give it up king
What did morj say
Why do people love the egg and scopper so much
> because the egg is just so random , such a theory bait <@690158729685106749>  <:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
And every shadow we see us scopper lol
Is the posirdon cycle by years or generation
So 100 years regardless of the generations passed
How can someone control posiedon tho
It‚Äôs a person not a ship
> She raised them in an incredible loving home and was seen as a saint to the public <@!114296407816404992>  but then she crushes all that by selling them which is worse than selling them from the beginning
What are blugori ? Like what type of creature
Those are some weird gorillas
Editor‚Äôs statement was dumb tbh
No need to lie for hype
> yaa its hard to feel for scabards <@741980477765845022>  wtf
Didn‚Äôt cry but it‚Äôs not like I didn‚Äôt feel for them
They‚Äôve been through 20 years of torture dude
I didn‚Äôt cry a lot in op
Queen disagrees
Luffy vs ussop was epic
Choosing right colors isn‚Äôt graphic design it‚Äôs common sense
But what did you expect from such channels
Hat toei is the best character in op
Look at his beauty
I loved hattori bashing that rope guy
Carrot has only her looks going for her
I never liked jinbe but I was happy to see him in wano
He will grow on us with time
Carrot has personality yes but not enough to be a straw hat member imo
I never really cared for her tbh
I sometimes forget that she exists but she‚Äôs cool tho
I like her connection with Pedro
Respectable
I wouldn‚Äôt Mind if carrot joins but I wouldn‚Äôt  mind not either
> if carrot joins the crew I will literally eat a bug in voice chat <@!289876647354826752>  I will remind you if she does
Yamato reminds me of old brash luffy I just love her
Or neither
Ulti and Yamato have somewhat similar personalities so far
What‚Äôs confusing about Yamato
> she want to become oden and all... <@741980477765845022>  it‚Äôs not the translation problem. She lit wants to be oden. That‚Äôs her goal and desire. Probably bc of kaido abusing her
Why do people hate peros lmao
> oh... but is she admiring oden or one time she said to luffy that you are more oden than me <@741980477765845022>  she meant that he‚Äôs more free than her just like oden was free. She was still wearing the cuffs and thinking about how her freedom is stolen so she won‚Äôt be able to become oden
Yeah it‚Äôs time for her  to become oden bc she is free and fight is starting against Kai
> oh i see <@!564773067969265674> <@741980477765845022>  I hope that I explained it well enough
You good stoppid
Can robin grow limbs is die of people
> <@!564773067969265674> If she can make a clone of herself, can she just sprout blood everywhere? <@!415999229564157955>  can she grow a mouth inside of kaido and bite his heart ?
Money underrated waifs
Kiku has been amazing especially in fights
> stupid half bird <@!724666824762982443>  and the discrimination continues
Monet is amazing man
She sacrificed her self too so she loyal
Vivi acts so childish sometimes
I still like her tho
But vivi is too naive
Ulti is brash not childish
No one hates carrot but those who like her like her too much so it drives people away
> <@!564773067969265674> Doesn't she have to see it tho (iirc)? If that's the case she'd have to create eyes inside his mouth and esophagus and then the mouth where the heart is. I believe in her <@!415999229564157955>  I don‚Äôt think that she can see his heart form his throat but good point
Carrot has best hair imo
Chopper looks 4 lol
Carrot might be the same as vivi situation
I like carrot as a character but I never thought of her as a straw hat
> <@!564773067969265674> She can't, but heart (specifically the left atrium) is directly in front of his esophagus (which goes to your stomach, it doesn't stay in the throat), so she'll see where it beats and just bite that part. She'll get the heart for sure, as it is really close. The esophagus is so close to the heart that the left atrium has an esophageal impression. Of course Oda knows this <@!415999229564157955>  that‚Äôs actually interesting but of course oda knows this and more
Is the carrot debate over
No seriously
Nice
I love the enthusiasm here
No plz tell me
I don‚Äôt know shit
Idk what do you wanna tell me about
What do you like most about the sunny
Weapons in wano are hella cool
Is it confirmed that that gorosei dude has the other kitetsu
Damn stoopid is goat
Brook no piano op is shit
Straw hat interactions lacking lately we need more oda
Chopper without his hat is weird tho
Sunny still has that make shift pool tho
They just don‚Äôt use it
Doffy veins sound in the anime is weird
Why is it delayed
So it‚Äôs late in Japan too not just viz
Lmao
It‚Äôs a good place to call home
Elaborate plz
Like what
Zoro is badass tho
Franky revers centaur us too op
Brook and robin are awakened change my mind
Is he hot
The suspense damn tanu
He‚Äôs really good tho
You mean animak with a c
lol why
It‚Äôs dumb but kinda funny
Do you watch the virgin podcast
What do you think
What tension
Are we watching the same podcast lol
But yeah it‚Äôs good really reasonable analysis
I love it when he gets annoyed
Animak is the one holding the thing together
Nux and Briggs are too chaotic
He‚Äôs just there to fanboy over stuff
He‚Äôs the kinda guy I wanna talk to about cool moments
The guests are cool tho
Nux is a shit poster
I went through a phase with his content
Nux has a fan base tho
No one understands zoro smh
I like nux in the podcast only
You should see their op podcast it‚Äôs hella dope
189
Nux is so dumb
You‚Äôre dumb for saying that
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
Nux is a necessary evil
Akainu is mega Japanese
Akainu‚Äôs face looks so Japanese and the Sakura tats too
Akainu sees himself as the lesser evil
Isn‚Äôt Hawaii part of America
I think Hawaii and Alaska are both American soil now
Yeah I know
I like how fleeb keeps throwing jokes tryna see what‚Äôll stick
That panel was weird
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
Im scared guys
Luffy wining against lucci after two rokugons was bs
Luffy was almost dead but he just stood up and fucked up lucci which was satisfying but not fair
How did that last Gatling gun finish lucci who was in better shape than luffy
Luffy took two rokugons dude
I genudont see it
Luffy was almost dead tho
Yeah so basically almost dead lol
I like the fight and I like lucci getting his ass beat but I feel weird about it
> I miss chibi Luffy <@!521427565492305931>  truest thing ever said
> <@!564773067969265674> then , how do you feel about luffy vs katakura , 11 hits vs 103 hits and luffy still won ? <@690158729685106749>  you might not like my answer but kata gave him the win kinda. It was a moral win rather than power. Kata was obviously leagues ahead
> you actually understood the fight , but don't use ' katakuri gave him the fight ' <@690158729685106749>  yeah that‚Äôs why I said kinda. Idk how to phrase stuff
Kata had stronger armament and future sight and his fruit was lit the upgraded version of luffy‚Äôs so he‚Äôs better in every way
Yeah but kata can sustain the same level of power but luffy can‚Äôt. And in the early armament clashes luffy got hurt
Kata coulda beat luffy earlier if he wanted but he liked luffy so he kept fighting
It‚Äôs not about who‚Äôs stronger it‚Äôs about respect and character
At least that‚Äôs how I see it
Exactly
Enel and croco boy were dumbasses
Kata vs luffy us one of if not the best fight
It has more depth
I love luffy vs bluno
Luffy fucked him hip good with gear 2
Man when he held his horns
It‚Äôs so satisfying
Telling him he can‚Äôt keep up with him anymore <:NamisNotOk:624327350410018838>
Zoro haki situation is very vague
A lot about zoro will be clear after wano
Ryuou might have diff forms or levels
I know that ryuou is just haki I swear. You know what I mean bro
I mean that what swordsmen use might be diff than what luffy uses now but it‚Äôs still ryuou
Japanese use forks and spoons for certain foods
Chopsticks are the best dude
Using chopsticks to cook is amazing
Really funny dude
Did you try using them
<:WBDisgust:650047749831524372>
Wano people say ryuou and they mean advanced so it‚Äôs probably the only one they know
Kaido last chapter says oden‚Äôs ryuou
Doesn‚Äôt kaido know what haki is
The ryuou thing is confusing
I will re read in Japanese from when ryuou is mentioned to try to understand
What chapter was ryuou first mentioned
> Well, he did it a bit more shady than that. It wasn't like he just made bad theories, he'd do translations and "facts" but pepper in his own opinion to decide an issue instead of just an unbiased translation <@!114296407816404992>  so his analysis is biased or does he star when it‚Äôs his opinion
> <@!564773067969265674> It'd be like he'd translate a vivre card and insert something that was just clear not on the card at all <@!114296407816404992>  oof if that‚Äôs true then I don‚Äôt know how to feel about him. I look up to his work man
Tontata were basically there to join the fleet otherwise dresssrosa woulda been the same
Chopper has good backstory tho
After 20 years of story and waiting a lot of people will be mad at the ending
Op is about the journey for me tho
I‚Äôll take any ending tbh
Man imagine a Friday with no op but there‚Äôs nothing next Friday
I can see op going for 7 more years
Yamato is huge
Sup guys
How long has chat been dead
Hey
Go to role info bro
Is there really nothing about op to talk about
Oda‚Äôs handwriting gives me pain
Wtf is uroge saying
Yeah but I‚Äôm rusty
Actually reading kanji is easier than words
Yeah I did the last 2
It‚Äôs easier bc you know the word without having to read letters
Much Faster too
Thx naism
I talked to juba
He sent me some better fonts
So it‚Äôll look cleaner next time
I talk when I feel safe
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
No I only did one
No unfortunately
French team has their own leaker for high quality scans
So raws we get won‚Äôt work
Thx tanu but I really don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm doing much
Joy boy does a good job mentioning the differences
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
He is cringy at times
But I like watching him fanboy over op in his room
Feels cosy
Does he really
I never heard him saying that
But I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised
I like the bleach aesthetic but I don‚Äôt think the story is as good as op
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
Cmon do it coward
Boooo
I except better from u tanu
Never thought about that
Zoro is oden confirmed
Yamato is oden zoro is oden I am oden
If Yamato becomes shogun the all the work was wasted
Not even hiyori Can become shogun
Jinbe was mentioned in baratie
How do you guys know all This
I need to get educated
Panda man is forever
Yamato still fresh tho give her time
I‚Äôm still now warmed up to jinbe yet tbh but I like him
Oda won‚Äôt kill a sh
I would like to see it tho
I don‚Äôt care who dies as long as it makes sense
Not all scabbards tho
I just don‚Äôt want kiku to die
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
I want to see koby in wano he needs to develop
Clothes
Remember zoro sitting on a grave foreshadowing
Why does everyone want ussop to die or get captured
Robin captured Is more interesting
She can do stuff
That‚Äôs actually true
I really feel for robin
Psychological torture
She held o the bridge with her teeth ffs
That scene broke me
I don‚Äôt like where this is going
Sad or badass
I really don‚Äôt like I wanna live but I like it‚Äôs build up
Didn‚Äôt impact me
No one deserves to die was better for me
I think she danced in wano
Robin stealing franky‚Äôa speedo was badass
Yes
Not cool
Tanu ftw
Nina haki too strong
I hate franky for getting all that love
Brook x chopper is weirder
Now you have you‚Äôre welcome
> r/chopperpiece <@!439770223944400896>  don‚Äôt remind me plz <:Crydo:586275183032270849>
Pudding is crazy and you know what they say about crazy
Kaido dodged a bullet by leaving rocks
Exactly
Especially with how genetics work in op
If bm eats bb will she have 3 df
Age is just a number prison is just a place
I mean if you were 17 would you marry a 40yo ?
Take it easy vergoat
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
Boa will hate that
Mine are 11 but it‚Äôs just weird still
How tf did we get here
Magellan was so cool
Do you think king is the same species as Magellan
General looks
Wings and black rubber suit
King is kinky
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
King seems competent
I mean kaido seems to rely on him
Tf is that abomination
So before kaido came to wano damn
Moria has potential
I don‚Äôt think taking kaido‚Äôs shadow is that easy
He thinks he‚Äôs smart with his plan but he‚Äôs just lazy
Damn oda‚Äôs art is amazing
Moria was in the middle of nowhere why would he use haki
It‚Äôs a discussion out of love for op
Part of the enjoyment
Marco might have a chance
Bepo sulong underrated
Yeah but people just dismiss him
Can Marco take damage without haki
I was surprised to see kiku stabbing kaido‚Äôs hand
Can she take his soul if he‚Äôs not afraid of he r
The yonkou have weird personalities
I‚Äôm over shanks at this point tbh
We don‚Äôt know anything about shanks so everyone is just throwing shit at the wall tryna see what‚Äôll stick
CBR are just trolls
Fmi 5th
That has some merit actually
Shanks is pure hype
Why doesn‚Äôt the wg kill doffy already
Oh shit I forgot but why is Magellan protecting him
Sitting at the toilet
Oden might‚Äôve told kaido smth that scared him
Kaido killed the hag to feel better but he still cheated
Kaido us a pirate after all so it might be fair game to him
Yeah he seems to think about that moment a lot
Momo is maning up lately
I like him
Luffy‚Äôs influence on momo is great
Man he‚Äôs just a fucking child
Let me see you standing up to big ass dude when you‚Äôre 9
> i wouldn't stand up to him i would have told him to kill me <@651757948061745162>  yeah I believe you
Tf is bluejam
Tf is that
Nah Yamato is female luffy
Yeah Yamato is just like the old luffy brash and wants to be free
I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs the queen tho
Maybe her daughter
I mean if the queen was missing all this time from the kingdom someone shoulda noticed right
Ulti using a mace is so cool
Seen it 100 times
That‚Äôs a actually funny
Why is she giving chopper a cucumber
Yeah how did people fall for it
Next chapter will be fire
Too bad there‚Äôs a break
See ya
Tf
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
Punk hazard I think
No
There hours to go
Doesn‚Äôt Crunchyroll have a manga section too
<:Crydo:586275183032270849>
You‚Äôre such a bully tilted
Sanji crying by the window broke my heart
Old why people hat wci
Fair
Doesn‚Äôt mha have better animation and pacing tho
I never got into it tbh and their fan base doesn‚Äôt help
> Oda reveals the "idc take this world building info" info in sbs <@310219637357019137>  oda might still care but he has no time to dive into it
True
Why did people hate oden dancung
It has a purpose obviously, we still don‚Äôt know oden‚Äôs intentions fully
Oden seems to believe hard on the prophecy of raftel or something
Does the grade of the sword affect its power or is it just notoriety
It‚Äôs just up to the user imo as long as the blade itself is good
Have we seen blades break bc the user us too strong
> Zoro straight up breaks any weak sword and that's before he even got that strong <@521783526878609418>  yeah but I mean good swords no the trash swords he used to break
Wadi will def stay with zoro
I think zoro will turn wado black no way he‚Äôs gonna break it or lose it
Is samurai gandhi confirmed to have shodai
A black blade isn‚Äôt stronger it‚Äôs just from the long term haki use right ? So why are you mad about wb blade not being black
So does the haki remain stored in the blade or is it just the color
But how does the blade become more tough if haki isn‚Äôt stored in it
I‚Äôm not sure but there was talk about how they‚Äôre tougher
Aren‚Äôt they stated not to break
Then that must be some headcanon I heard somewhere
No I understand what Mihaawk meant
It‚Äôs called night
Lol
Barely saved it
I like the haki aura thing actually
Hyo stated that luffy needs to use the extra haki escaping his body to use ryuou
The anime is pushing the aura too hard
They need to tone it down
Quantified power levels ruin a series look at dbz and sds
Seven deadly sins
Same with sds
They realized it was dumb
The aura can be good if done well
Yeah it‚Äôs bad rn
Maybe a small transparent aura would be good
Just to show haki flow like nen but more toned down
What‚Äôs is canon lmao
They can tone it down even more than oda and make it colorless
The anime is great rn
I don‚Äôt think the aura will be used hard every time someone uses adv haki in the future
Chill Alex it‚Äôs just a discussion
Yeah but we can still talk about it
Doom with the facts
Wano colors for some people real mad
Coc in movies is cool but too much imo
Coc can‚Äôt just be to knock out fodder tho
How
There‚Äôs def more to coc
It‚Äôs been hyped since day 1
Yeah shonks damaged wb ship with his coc but I don‚Äôt think luffy can do that yet
Roger clashing with wb without touching. Us that coc or adv armament
Lmao
Hiyori is nowhere to be seen rn
I don‚Äôt trust hiyori bro
Tanu rn
> Anyone know what time knew chapter is out? I was reading that it‚Äôs at 11 am est <@739821850527399996>  less than 90 min till it‚Äôs out
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
What is happening here
Lol
Asian people start aging at 70
Short hair nami is very nami
> Ah, but you see, Nami has bangs now. Truly, a maturing woman. <@!274366418223497217>  that‚Äôs just shaki with nami tattoo
Do those exist
Oof
Doom who hurt you
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
I feel scared
Tf is yc
Doom I don‚Äôt know what I did I but I‚Äôm sorry
Plz
<:Crydo:586275183032270849>
Little did they know doom is the biggest degenerate of all
Reverse uno card
Chill tanu plz
Be even more chill
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
What do you need goose
Like in what way
The roger message or the poneglyph it self
Ulti was introduced after ace so ulti > ace
> New chapter out yet? <@!107217661628301312>  30 min
Catarina‚Äôs fruit might have a handicap just like bonclay
Ofc nami thumbnail
You ate the bait tanu
Zoro vs kamazo was dope
Urashima vs luffy was bs but other than that it‚Äôs been great imo
> i wish one piece kai is just one piece but its done in classic style <@!198930928083402753>  and 4:3 aspect ratio  <:MomoCreep:624652617431253033>
> <@!564773067969265674> YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES <@!198930928083402753>  someone finally understands
Old music art style and color palletr too
iPads have 4:3 too
Look at his fat jiggle
Oof ussop
Official is out guys
Why do they split them
Thx doom
Queen is goat
Break week officially started
<:Crydo:586275183032270849>
Lmao
Where do you find this shit Jaguar
Damn
Luffy Kidd and law fighting in the new op is sooo good
Bro you want me to remember ending 1
It‚Äôs been years
The one with the crew standing by the sea
On sunset
loli a that a real thumbnail
Hey doom how many hours a day do you spend here
He‚Äôs a mod right
Do they get paid for this lol
Do they have a life
But I‚Äôm asking for real
I‚Äôm just curious
You got it boss
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
So should I ask less questions or just be here less
I‚Äôm sorry if I seem like a shit poster I‚Äôm still new here and figuring stuff out
I‚Äôm not intentionally doing it
I don‚Äôt care about the  ban or warning. I love this place so I don‚Äôt wanna ruin the experience for others
I still believe that kaido is tough due to haki
Just like bm
Why is bm so tough ? Did we get an explanation
Genetics of whom ? Her parents were normal
> <@!564773067969265674> How different is it reading the official or scanned translation vs original japanese <@703504844903940096>  reading the Japanese is the best experience you‚Äôll get bc of all of the nuances Japanese has so you‚Äôll enjoy all the jokes puns and specific meanings. Fan translations are diff, batoto tries to be ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù so they do it like the official whereas I try to keep the raw Japanese experience like oda writes it without westernizing the story by paraphrasing and such but all fan translations will have mistakes unless corrected later. The official has the best translation but it makes the story lose a lot of the nuances and sometimes change the order of speech bubbles or even entire sentences. So it‚Äôs better to read all the fan translations and the official too unless you wanna learn Japanese to have the best experience but that‚Äôll take you years to appreciate and understand everything
There‚Äôs no absolute win here tbh
> I would love to do that if I ever get the time <@703504844903940096>  even tho I understand Japanese I still spend 4-7 to check every word in a dictionary sine some words can have 15-100 meanings so I try to come up with the best translation possible which is still tough so I leave notes explaining stuff about the Japanese wording at the end
It‚Äôs beautiful tho I love it
It‚Äôs all for the fandom man so if anyone has any feedback I‚Äôll appreciate it. Also please tolerate my mistakes since I‚Äôm not a native Japanese speaker
Thx for the appreciation though
Who do you guys think will die in wano other than scabbards
Who cares about fodder
How would they capture him tho
Did a month pass since the full moon in wci ? Could the op world have multiple moons
I think it‚Äôs only been like 2 weeks
Yeah that panel
We don‚Äôt see everything in op
What could those things around the planet be ? Other planets
They‚Äôre most likely moons
Enel didn‚Äôt say he was going to the moon
He just wanted to go up
Enel just ended up in the moon
Was there vearth in the moon ? Isn‚Äôt it just rocks
I trust the Ohara people
Oda also made sure to show the figure
Could those multiple moons have to do with ancient history since that what they studied at ohara
Could be
They say full moon because in Japanese there no plural so it‚Äôs up for debate
Could the moons have been destroyed in the void century
Yeah we could only see one moon at time too
It‚Äôs all possible
Yeah but the moons might have a cycle where only one is visible at a time
Multiple moons might have to do with the calm belt
Since gravity and a
Like maybe the gravity of one moon affecting the waves could be canceled by the other moons so we get the calm belt
> What if there are two sanjis <@!206896898215378945>  asking the real questions
If multiple moons is the norm then they won‚Äôt talk about it
I get it but it would be interesting
Uruanus could‚Äôve been used to destroy the moons in the void century so now there‚Äôs one only
Yeah it‚Äôs been 800 years so geography could‚Äôve changed
Watch the egg being a troll
Fleeb the theorist
Do we know why there‚Äôs no currents in the calm belt and why seakings lie there mostly
Germa can clone people ffs so technology exists for sure but it has to be different based on the island or the sea
They‚Äôre too small to be planets
Their model has to be significant otherwise why would oda show it
Enel went to the moon and oda showed us a model by some of the smartest and dedicated people so it has to be relevant
The evidence does both ways here
Op world is mostly like ours but oda can come out and say the moon cycle is a month and half or something so we can‚Äôt say for sure since there‚Äôs no concrete way
What was that hole anyways
Or they just lied
Hello
I doubt all scabbards will die
Some surly will
One heat breath and they‚Äôre gone
Kin cuts fire but kaido obliterates mountains
Would be cool to see ngl
I lit jumped when Marco showed up
Luffy is serious now
It‚Äôs scary
I‚Äôm curious as to how much luffy will do here
I think kin smiled bc he‚Äôs happy that they‚Äôre finally gonna achieve their goal and it‚Äôs thanks to luffy I doubt it has to do with confidence
Wano has been great
Years of waiting for wano and it‚Äôs finally here
She will mostly fight peros
> as said, it's unlikely they could ever take him down eitehr, but they know that <@160778857702490113>  do they really know
They are going into the fight with their all they must think they have a chance
Actually nvm my brain stopped there kin‚Äôs speech last chapter is enough proof
Yeah
I feel like kiku is gonna die and it saddens me
Can‚Äôt wait for sulong bepo
Bepo will one shot kaido
He‚Äôs the best
Bepo was being bullied by satchi and penguin before law found him lama
Bounce his ass to space
Enel is amino on steroids
Rayleigh is too old rn
Isn‚Äôt his a mythical tho
Aren‚Äôt human fruits mythical tho just like sengoku
Why does shonen always go crazy with the hair
There should a limit tho
It‚Äôs like a scale of power
> I swear to God Mip if you say "you can't have characters that are too strong" you're going to set me off <@!289876647354826752>  what did I do. I just find it weird that hair is agreed upon as a way to show power. I never said it wasn‚Äôt cool
You know what I mean bro
Jokes on you I‚Äôm already dead
I mean dbz and now sulong so...
Why do I even talk. I should shut up
That‚Äôs the point
How did the toilet discussion start
Stoopid says 3
I hate that
Nice pfp <@!300398217001173002> flapjack was my childhood
Does feanky have a neck
This chat is more dead than ace
I think he means real life time
The one piece is most likely just info and gr treasure
Roger left his treasure  there
The op itself is probably the last poneglyph
The last info not road poneglyph

I have info about the void century I think
That‚Äôs a good question
But he can still take down buildings
Stoopid you‚Äôre amazing
Law is broken
When was that implied
If brook left his body then bb touched him would he down
Bb should
The fruit has to be tied to the user so brook‚Äôs soul is connected to the fruit which is active
The problem with brook is that he‚Äôs a skeleton
How do you kill what‚Äôs already dead
Brook should float tho
He can walk on water
I don‚Äôt think the water makes them sink
It‚Äôs their weight
How does brook drown if he‚Äôs dead
He doesn‚Äôt need food or oxygen
Does breaking his bones kill him
Brook is immortal dude
> <@!419608704418054157> And laughed while destroying countless families around the world <@!415999229564157955>  you win some you lose some
We need more buggy ball
Isn‚Äôt there haki shigan too
When bb uses black hole are the things he swallows held inside of him ?
Is it infinite space ? Can logia users generate infinite substance of their fruit
Why can‚Äôt someone like akainu hold stuff inside of him if caribu can
Caribu is just dirt and water tho. I understand how bb works since it‚Äôs darkness and black holes but how does caribu work
Yeah I know
But caribu isn‚Äôt a black hole
Can‚Äôt a pool of lava have things inside
Lmao
He can tech harden some lava and hold stuff inside
Yeah it‚Äôs just properties of the fruit
I just get hung up on technicalities
It‚Äôs actually quite op to be able to produce an infinite amount of a certain substance
Btw is kata mochi or can he just produce it
Kiku was not
But he‚Äôs a paramicia
Yeah but I‚Äôm still confused as to how that works
So he has all logia properties
If you can turn into a plant it‚Äôs probably a zoan but if you can sprout plants like in film z then it‚Äôs a paramicia. Imo
Paramicia don‚Äôt include living creatures. As in turning into one
In film z the girl sprouts plants
Could be special zoan
I mean if someone can become a plant like a fly trap or smth. That can‚Äôt be paramicia since your turning into another creature
Yeah special zoan makes sense to me
That‚Äôs a paramicia imo
You can‚Äôt become dirt can you
Yeah why not
But if it‚Äôs a logia and sprouts plants that‚Äôd be too much even tho it‚Äôs kinda useless
Like too many abilities for one fruit.  But the. There‚Äôs sugar so it‚Äôs probably fine
Is the crow revolutionary guy a paramicia
That just makes things worse lol
If he can turn into crows it‚Äôs should be zoan but since it‚Äôs multiple it‚Äôs a paramicia
It‚Äôs either zoan or paramicia
I bet it‚Äôs paramicia
Crow logia wtf
Maybe it‚Äôs not crows but he chooses to make crows out of his logia substance
It has to be smth light since they can fly
> <@!564773067969265674> Hmmmmmm... plasticine logia. But has he has all the colours, it is always black bc they are all mixed <@!415999229564157955>  tf is plasticine
Flexing medical knowledge
Still don‚Äôt know what that is lmao but I doubt oda will go there
I never had playdough only generic shit
Who falls for those titles anyway
Hey there
Can tamago die
Amazon has then yeah
Check bookstores near you too
You can find people selling on eBay for much cheaper
> <@564773067969265674>  That would be nice <@742532068608704532>  I‚Äôve seen collections of 50 volumes up for like 20-50$
You can support oda by buying merch
> Damn, I wonder what you'd find inside those to be so cheap <@!415999229564157955>  it‚Äôs mostly volumes not in order and people don‚Äôt buy used volumes for the price of the new so it‚Äôs dirt cheap. So you‚Äôll get some from alabasta and all of wano for example
Hyogoro basically confirmed that zoro used ryuou in alabasta in chapter 939
It coulda been haki. True
Glr had a color spread analysis this chapter lol
It was amazing
Bc he appreciates art
Would probably revert to a human
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
Can you hit me there
Damn you got me there
Some high standards here
He dodged the jelly bean jut like you dodge facts strong
!lanji2
Tits kill sanji get your facts straight
Can‚Äôt see shit bro
Who tf has unsymmetrical eyebrows
4kids made crocodile say desert doodoo ffs
<:TamaHuh:735289165109002260>
I still enjoyed it tho
Anime
People sleep on thriller bark too much
You didn‚Äôt like Kuma
English is easy bro
About what
A speech about sports ?
How many hours away is that
In your time
It‚Äôs 4 am for me rn
If I‚Äôm awake then I‚Äôll help you
Bye
Cringe is his brand
Tekking is like your friend who you talk about op with
Berry yeah
Someone sent tekking a cinder block in the mail
Some people dropped videos before the French scans even
Isn‚Äôt Ohara reviewing the Japanese rn
He‚Äôs pretty good iirc
I‚Äôve been loving mr morj lately
Bda is good too
Glr is really good
Yeah but it‚Äôs nicer to listen to a vid than read the wiki
What did he say
It‚Äôs obviously acting
What‚Äôs he on
That‚Äôs a big oof
It‚Äôs his opinion but it‚Äôs a shit opinion ngl
Is franky infertil now
<#513313101337329665>
I think
Robin was always weird tho
Only the <:RobinHUH:665766366481219614> face was surprising tbh
Robin in 984 is totally within her character she‚Äôs always dark and gloomy
Nami in wci looked so cool
Robins needs smth similar
Pre ts robin outfits were better IMO
> I prefer short hair Nami back in Sabaody <@319602380041879552>  big facts
Enies lobby nami outfit was weird
Like the design
All that can fight at least
Can stussy use haki with her long range shigan
Yeah
I feel like denjiro has smth up his sleeve
Sup
Wtf gaben
No one cares about bepo smh
I think I‚Äôd ulti or black Maria were about to kill one of the sh then sanji surely will fight them
Sanji needs better armament
Invisibility is broken rn
Observation should counter it imo
A yonkou should have no problem with invisibility
If someone has future sight then they can at least see themselves get hit by an invisible attack
Fuji can see everything so observation has some merit
You just need to be faster
Future sight has limits too and someone might be better than others in terms of how long into the future they can see
Endurance probably or who can dodge and attack more
But you need high focus for future sight
In a fast pace battle it‚Äôs harder
True
An expert fighter can probably dodge without future sight
It helps tho
I think future sight is overrated a little bit
It won‚Äôt protect you from everything
Yeah oda is who decides but there has to be rules an mechanics
Yeah but he can‚Äôt just negate previous rules just bc he wants to that‚Äôs called an ass pull
Yeah kata was incredibly fast that he dodged some snakeman hits too
If both are future sight masters and have the same speed then it would be up to who cal land more hits
It has stronger armament
It‚Äôs not like you can dodge all hits just because you have future sight
You‚Äôd still have to rank some
Some techniques could be useful like when luffy hit kata even tho he used future sight bc kata didn‚Äôt look far enough into the future
I think it‚Äôs all about limits
Like if kizaru is the fastest then no one can dodge him
But he‚Äôs on unit infinitely fast
I think it‚Äôs safe to say that it‚Äôs about the full package not just individual things
You can tell Japanese by hiragana and katakana
Chinese is just kanji
Do you guys think luffy can beat kata just with adv armament
Like a full fledged win
No I mean just with the upgrade of adv armament lmao
Is that enough to say that he‚Äôs stronger than kata
Aokiji is experienced so he knows what to do without future sight
Btw why did kata hurt luffy when they first had armament clash ? Was it stronger haki or kata‚Äôs fruit
Kaido seems ok o have a soft side to him
He didn‚Äôt kill momo bc he wasn‚Äôt sure if he‚Äôs a kouzuki
Yeah he‚Äôs not dumb so he has to finish off the kouzukis but he‚Äôs not a total savage to a certain degree
Yeah but he seems to have some morals
I didn‚Äôt say he wasn‚Äôt evil
True
I really want to know his reason for wanting war
I feel like oden told him smth
Kaido bad as a reason for war  would be stupid ngl
But even real life morals are not that great
Technically bm is good bc she wants no racism but her execution is bad
Luffy wants freedom but he wants all the meat
I mean her goal is good but her ways are what‚Äôs wrong
Yeah bc the pk is the most free
He told that to Rayleigh
> Is that why he wants to be the pirate king? <@!297795816255389697>  yeah he told that to Rayleigh in shabondy
> Were the marines bad for wanting to execute ace? <@703504844903940096>  everyone sees themselves as the good side or the lesser evil at least
That‚Äôs not how it works spunk
Luffy isn‚Äôt your conventional good guy. He‚Äôs a pirate and he is selfish bc he only cares about those close to him
When did he share his meat
> bb the main villain is waay better than even some of the early villains like krieg <@703504844903940096>  just bc someone is a loser doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs a bad character. Kreig and Moria were defeated and straight up bad people but they were still good characters with reasonable motives
Yeah which gives him character
Oh I see but that‚Äôs hella subjective
But we still don‚Äôt know bb motives or goals
Bb might want to destroy the world
Yeah I can agree with you on that
Luffy is weird bc he is selfish mostly but he still helped vivi and fmi
He doesn‚Äôt like to see people‚Äôs freedom taken away
Yeah luffy is a better pirate I can agree
Yeah wb helped a lot of people
Bonney Kidd and bb are the realest pirates
Yeah her general attitude
> WB wont care about morals if you hurt his crew member <@703504844903940096>  yeah but that‚Äôs reasonable since they attacked his crew first. Wb won‚Äôt go out of his way to hurt people
Kidd is actually the most ‚Äúpirate‚Äù bc he likes hurting people krieg only idea it when necessary for him just like bb
Yeah there‚Äôs actually no full fledged pirates in op. Like the Tortola package I mean
Bonney seems to care about kuma so that doesn‚Äôt make her necessarily nice imo
Iirc real life pirates at least some of them enjoyed killing people even if they surrendered
Yeah I get it but I just mean that they enjoyed killing to the point that some used to bathe in and drink blood
They were savages to a degree
I might need to look into it more. My knowledge could be shaky
It‚Äôs not just the stereotype. I remember watching a video or reading somewhere about how cruel they were for the fuck of it  but it could be fake or bad sources
Yeah greedy  leaders were a big thing back then
Yeah they rigged the system to their advantage right ?
Corruption won‚Äôt go away as long as greed exists
Nah it‚Äôs just oda having fun
People read into color spreads too much
Remember zoro sitting on a greave with a number of an upcoming chapter. People said he will die then
Yeah
That was the dumbest theory I‚Äôve ever heard
One color spread had the kouzuki symbol on the straw hats kimonos. That was cool. It was like hundreds of chapters back
Yeah that one
Soooo cool
It‚Äôs just that oda wanted to reach wano so bad but he wanted to show some of it earlier
Ace dying was monumental
Iirc oda always wanted to draw the straw hats in samurai shields but he had to change it to the beast pirates outfit for the plot so he did it before the raid
Luffy had to lean his lesson the hard way
It‚Äôs a miracle he survived
Luffy is still reckless even tho he matured
> <@!564773067969265674> - Ace's death didn't affect his personality massively, but increased his motive to focus on what was important at that time: becoming strong enough to protect his friends, which forced him to mature and become a little more wise. <@524603876482220093>  exactly, the point of ace‚Äôs death wasn‚Äôt for him to change as a person rather learn to evaluate the situation. But he‚Äôs still reckless to this day I mean he barged in on two yonkou
Luffy used to live in his own world no he knows to look at reality
Luffy has battle smarts more than life
That kaido poster oof
Bounty standard weee diff back then
He was the 2nd commander so he was hyped
Ace had potential but he was a device
Now we know that commander position means nothing but back then...
Who wrote the novels
I thought it‚Äôs only not illustrated by oda
Is the writer from his staff or an outsource
Neither are ded
Unfinished arcs pendas
It would be nice to see orochi dead but it‚Äôs anti climactic
I can accept that orochi is dead but kanjuro Isn‚Äôt
Maybe
Orochi might be able to sprout a new body
You nerve know
He abused hiyori so he has unfinished business not to mention his story with oden
I like they way kaido ‚Äúkilled‚Äù him it was satisfying but he has more to do
The point of kaido not needing him was served so it‚Äôs okay if he lives
If orochi lives bc he took precautions it would add to his character actually
Kanjuro had a good backstory
Kaido didn‚Äôt need orochi to rule wano or get in
Orochi is a coward but he‚Äôs not dumb so he might have known that kaido would do this and made sure he‚Äôd survive
> <@!564773067969265674> so you're saying kaido and him planned him faking his death <@738998014039031888>  that could be possible, but I mean that orochi must‚Äôve known that kaido would dispose of him at some point so he made sure to prepare and escape. That would improve his character imo
> <@564773067969265674> would make no sense to me even if he survives what does that mean he has to escape and then what? He is not important anymore <@606196171307745308>  he‚Äôs not important to kaido, yes. But he has unfinished business with the kouzukis
Why do people think orochi is dumb ?
Orochi abused hiyori ffs
He‚Äôs a big pussy yes but not dumb
> <@564773067969265674> so he dies anyway <@606196171307745308>  I see why being murder fuel is bad but he can‚Äôt die now. It‚Äôs  Just how I see it
I‚Äôm not sure bc hiyori said she doesn‚Äôt want to interfere with the battle
But orochi used her as a wax toy for years so smth has to happen
No it‚Äôs a break
Enma seems to have to do with aura so if it‚Äôs adv haki the zoro probably can hurt him but not kill him
Does enma force ryuou
We see an aura around enma so I think it‚Äôs adv haki
Luffy says he‚Äôll follow kin later so he probably will deal with bm for now
Neko and inu seem promising ngl
I just want zoro action whatever it is
> If the enma is forcing its Wilders haki into the sword could it be possible that the opponents haki is also sucked in by touching it? <@606196171307745308>  that‚Äôs a good question. It might block their haki where it makes contact
Cursed swords have their own will
Do we know how to curse a sword ?
It‚Äôs just that  cursed swords list for blood then
Gaben has been really hilarious today
Is that guy actually named Gandhi lmao
Raizo shoulda poked kaido‚Äôs eye
If he‚Äôd stuck a bomb down kaido‚Äôs throat then could‚Äôve beeb done for lmao
Kiku is dying mark my words. It‚Äôs sad tho
I love kiku man
I hope she won‚Äôt
Why do people hate raizo lol
Hell yeah doom
Kin is probably dying yes
Does raizo have a df
I always forget otsuru
Oda‚Äôs art has been amazing in wano
Who cares About shinobu
Weren‚Äôt the onibanshou a small group like 10 lead but fuko ? When did they become 5000
He has long earlobes too right
Toko crying over yasu broke me
Can‚Äôt coc have to do with how tough bm and kaido are
Flying like floating or flapping wings
He has a division so he already has responsibilities
> Nice monet pfp shes underrated <@564773067969265674> <@!220515768897372160>  finaaaaaaaly someone gets it
I can see what you mean Alex but it won‚Äôt make him stronger rather even more mature or smth
Marco has no desire to be a captain
He wants to protect what wb had
He‚Äôs so loyal
Ace had personality and potential
Also the connection and interaction  with luffy made people like him
True he shoulda ignored magma boo
Ace was a device and nothing more
> Well when some asshole just killed your friends and family in front of you then calls your Dad a coward I doubt anyone would walk away <@683663101186277416>  I would
He‚Äôs lovable for his personality but he did nothing
Ace was hella funny ngl
What did ace achieve ? As a character
> <@564773067969265674>  > He was known enough to be a warlord <@521783526878609418>  yeah but I mean what did he do within the time we see him ?
> Define an achievement as a character <@!114296407816404992>  what did I ace do that makes him a good character
He appears then gets captured and dies a stupid death
I like him a lot don‚Äôt get me wrong but he has no substance other than his connection and interactions with luffy
> Did you miss the entire blackbeard vs ace plotline?<@564773067969265674> <@683663101186277416>  where he got his ass handed to him
Look I‚Äôm not hating on ace I love his chateau it other than that he didn‚Äôt do much for me
The only substance I see in him is his funny and chill personality
He‚Äôs cool too
> <@564773067969265674> I want you to know the way you feel about Ace is the way I feel about Carrot <@521783526878609418>  how do you feel about her <:TamaThink:741812943913746473>
> His last line to luffy, "thank you for loving me," wasnt just a line. It showed how unworthy ace felt to be loved, to the extent that he thought he needed to thank HIS OWN LITTLE BROTHER for caring about him <@!131218004540129280>  actually I take it back this was good enough
People hate carrot not for her personality but those who love her love her too much
<@!415999229564157955> yeah I always forget about his childhood for some reason. I take back what I said, he‚Äôs actually cool. I never disliked him anyway, but I just wanted to see more of him
Wasn‚Äôt Marco too young
The crew could‚Äôve been smaller then so less commanders
Was oden actually given a commander position? Didn‚Äôt wb consider him his brother so like 1st mate
Coded we all know what we mean chill
Damnit vegito
Whiteybay wasn‚Äôt in mf?
Did whitey bay in the payback war
Lmao
> <@!564773067969265674> why did you change your pfp from best girl to this , what a downgrade <:aFeelsAceMan:586371608382537759> <@328936254978916352> i like that you like Yamato but I‚Äôve been feeling money lately
Yeah that Yamato panel was dope
Dora you‚Äôre a devil
Kanmui no
Chapter 950 lol
Why does also manga exist
Too crowded ? It feels like there‚Äôs only 30 people here lmao
No I don‚Äôt come here on chapter day
> took 2 enraged punches from the ' strongest man in the world ' and finished the day without any serious damage , who else can claim that ? <@328936254978916352>  that was bs he shoulda died in mf
You lose either way coded
Does the zoro sanji debate happen daily lmao
Damn stoopid with the sources
Oda doesn‚Äôt draw all scars for ease
I think he stated it in an sbs
It will
I doubt toki is dead
I still feel weird about the toki hiyori situation
I don‚Äôt feel safe here lmao
But seriously I‚Äôm not sure how to feel about konurasaki is hiyori. I still don‚Äôt believe it
What Can‚Äôt I have opinions
The scar will be relevant
She just gave in too quick and told zoro everything
It‚Äôs weird
Still why did she tell a stranger
Please kamui
She ha some big info about zoro trust me
Fair
Who made those commands lmao
Damn okama
Ironic
Manga
In Arabic
<:FujiKEK:623815945437052928>
Hey <@319602380041879552> what‚Äôs the anime in your pfp
Is it any good
Bm crew seems better than kaido. Her crew is more held together
Bm is her own worst enemy
But bm crew care about each other unlike kaido‚Äôs
They respect kata too
Mega assholes yeah
But sasaki and who‚Äôs who seem to not give a shit
The core of bm is all brothers and sisters while kaido‚Äôs is former defeated pirates so it‚Äôs more fragile
The mostly fear kaido except ulti who loves him lol
> doffy and viola had a sexual relationship? <@509083474955599874>  is said that deessrosa sure is a passionate town when he was asked about that
They had some tension
Especially before luffy fought doffy for the 2nd time
Doffy is a chad
Yes kilua but people asked and oda answered
To piss off robin fans
Alex is edgy
Zoro x hiyori is where it‚Äôs at
Chill Alex its a joke
Zoro x smoker in Tashigi‚Äôs body <:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
Chopper x brook
<:SaboEvil:705903442995970058>
Poor law
97 is still a month away so it‚Äôs still some time for the cover
Too sad they abandoned the samurai outfits
Didn‚Äôt robin find the poneglyph room
Is the last road poneglyph lost
I ordered 95 and 96 can‚Äôt wait to get it
Where does box set 3 end
> :GWnatesnowSad: <@272064319661801473>  volumes in Japan cost 440 yen so 4$ or less
> <@!564773067969265674> i'm not buying loose copies like some plebe <@272064319661801473>  it‚Äôs the official from shueisha
Can bm make homies from islands tho
Black Maria is fine
Black Maria unites this server damn
Let him I‚Äôm liking it
That‚Äôs not better kamui
Jack is underrated
Fuck decken
Is that the past or present ? It‚Äôs amazing
Oda has something with camels
Here, eyelashes and aikiji‚Äôs penguin is named camel
Wasn‚Äôt that ace

All three did
Shit I‚Äôm late
Why did bb attack the revolutionaries anyway
> do you remember a chapter? <@!372464153480134666>  brook vs oven was 864 I think
I still can‚Äôt tell if the daily sanji vs zoro arguments are jokes or serious lmao
Btw the sound of it it seems like I shouldn‚Äôt
How did we get here <:TamaHuh:735289165109002260>
Thx slim
It‚Äôs not a guarantee that we‚Äôll get and explanation, could just be like ‚Äúzoro has asura‚Äù
Cursed blades lust for blood iirc
Doom the wiki says that zoro said kitetsu is bloodthirsty and wanted to make slashes without his direction describing it as a problem child. Idk the chapter unfortunately
Hitetsu has nidia now
That‚Äôs pretty sick ngl
Why should Yamato use a sword
It‚Äôs cool that Yamato has parts in her personality from both oden and kaido
I know but she‚Äôs like their love child lol
Maybe kaido didn‚Äôt allow her to learn to use a sword
^
Gotta dance naked for five years too
Kaido destroyed the roof yeah
You mean when they were in roger‚Äôs execution
^
Was it yesterday
It‚Äôs such a good podcast
The title is always wrong lmao
Does nitro just let you post gifs
It‚Äôs a good way to support discord but it feels like a scam to me lol
But then Agian I‚Äôm cheap af
That‚Äôs nitro classic right, what‚Äôs the 10$ thing then
That pun hurts me deeply
<:WBDisgust:650047749831524372>
Spoilers should come out in 7-8 days so it‚Äôs not that bad
Monet is best girl fight me
You‚Äôre too simple minded pound smh
Did you watch any of the anime perona
Perona is hilarious
I actually don‚Äôt mind spoilers too especially with a series like op since there‚Äôs way more thank just the big reveals. I still prefer not be spoiled but it‚Äôs not a big deal
The fact that he didn‚Äôt kill sasaki tells me that he likes or at least doesn‚Äôt blame him and his beef is with kaido and orochi only
Luffy will eat kaido‚Äôs shadow
^
Hawkins power seems like an ass pull to me
If it‚Äôs smth like gon from HxH I‚Äôd be fine with it
If the Hawkins power up works like ivankov‚Äôs hormones and has a consequence I‚Äôd be fine
If there‚Äôs no consequences then it‚Äôs just fairytale at this point lmao
It would be too convenient for Hawkins to draw a good card for luffy to use vs kaido imo
I‚Äôd like to see Moria redeem himself in wano
Best place to live
<:TamaHuh:735289165109002260>
No plz
^
Speaking of headcanon
I have a crackpot theory
What if denjiro looks back at all the pain he lived through for 20 years while kin traveled through time and didn‚Äôt have to deal with that pain. So he sees him self as the rightful heir to the shogun position. That‚Äôs why he didn‚Äôt kill sasaki since he‚Äôs allied with him and maybe who‚Äôs who too since they want to take higher positions. That will also give a diff side to him saying ‚Äúkin is so smart‚Äù so it‚Äôs condescending and not blind trust. I believe this since it was too obvious that kyoshiro is denjiro and the twist is yet to come
I‚Äôm too big brain I know
I warned you that it‚Äôs headcanon
I just find that kyoshiro is denjiro and komurasaki is hiyori too obvious
I neeeed more twists
Bro it‚Äôs a crackpot theory chili plz
> its too obvious because we talk about one piece every time , i am sure a binge reader would be blown by the last few chapters of oden flashback <@328936254978916352>  yeah that‚Äôs true
Lmao
Is there a time limit for sulong
So if neko and inu use sulong with haki they won‚Äôt last that long damn
I doubt neko and inu will stop even if it kills them
They have a fighting chance but not an edge over kaido no way
Didn‚Äôt oden give his journal to toki
It should be in good condition
I think oden or doffy told kaido smth about the d that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs scared and wants war
Kaido seems to fear oden and the ptsd last chapter is weird
Yeah it‚Äôs all speculation
> And what about learning about the D would make him want war? <@698761447835959337>  you know all the stuff about fate and joyboy and how the world is changing so he might want war to prevent whatever is coming
Kaido is bored or kaido is bad isn‚Äôt really a good or convincing reason for war
Unicorn tree duo is the best
I don‚Äôt remember anything from zou lmao
> <@!564773067969265674> You don't remember Carrot no diffing Zoro? <@!415999229564157955>  how could I forget. Have faith in me stoopid
What chapter does act 2 start at
Does anyone know where I can read op in Japanese online
Pre ts anime was the shit
> you mean the slideshow? <@272064319661801473>  the 4:3 aspect ratio mah dude
Oof
^
Every arc in op has its charm
Is it bad that I like kurro
Jango was hilarious
Nami throwing zoro over  the oil was funny
Toko broke my heart crying over yasu
Who‚Äôs rika
Oh yeah she was amazing too
We got to see zoro acting all compassionate eating her onigiri lmao
They were modeled after fruit just like momo
<:Crydo:586275183032270849>
Stoopid is amazing damn
How do you know all this shit
Stoopid knows batchi which is all that matters
Really
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
Kuro had haki in his fingers
Zoro okama confirmed
Don‚Äôt we all
Would koby even know her at this point
How ? Even her voice is diff
Can swords cut alvida or does her fruit protect her
Stoopid do you write fan fics in your free time lmao
It pays well I hate
Kiku can be whatever she wants
You‚Äôd have to go through me fist stoopid
> <@!564773067969265674> Don't u see my name, young one? <@!415999229564157955>  boasting your status is an act of weakness and insecurity
Doesn‚Äôt matter beat
Inu is like half as tall as kiku
Why are the scabbards so huge
Imagine using feet instead of meters
How many ounces are in a gallon zeph
<:ShanksHmmm:586437070742880257>
The imperial system isn‚Äôt even a system lmao
No it‚Äôs just a collection of diff measurement units. Look it up
Who even makes a unit of 12 zeph wtf
People from wano seem to be huge Henry
Is judge fat or muscle
Faire enough
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
How do you know zeph <:TamaThink:741812943913746473>
Maybe too cultured even
I just took the term to mean red neck
Nah ryuou last episode was well done imo
Raizo played udon like a violin
> The only person can take that sword from him is kuina <@680153434238091317>  it‚Äôs just a color spread it has nothing to do with the story
Raizo shoulda poked kaido‚Äôs eye smh
> <@285327673553846272> luffy carrying sabo stick is not just an art <@680153434238091317>  luffy sabo and ace all used pipes when they were kids
People give pudding a lot of shit. She was good tho
> <@564773067969265674> I gonna roast you guys so bad when sabo appears in wano <@680153434238091317>  even if he appears the color spread has nothing to do with it
> <@564773067969265674> isn't that the chapter cover? <@680153434238091317>  it‚Äôs just art !! It has nothing to do with the story unlike cover stories
Kiku stabbed kaido‚Äôs hand she‚Äôs dope bro
Tf coded
Training with enma are zoro lean to control his haki so it‚Äôs kind of a power up
Pica level Jesus
Hitwtsu told zoro that he‚Äôs gotten better at using enma so he trained with it
How long does it take a blade to become black
Do we know
Yeah Mihawk wants to chill
Kyros song was adorable
Would anyone be mad if zoro killed kaido tho
I‚Äôll be happy with any zoro action
Zoro hasn‚Äôt had a good fight since dressrosa
^
> <@564773067969265674> i would say kamazou(killer) was more hard then pica <@606196171307745308>  pica was just bs. Kamazo was way cooler but I want zoro to go all out it‚Äôs been years dude
The most I can see zoro doing is cutting kaido or smth but no way he kills him
> <@564773067969265674> what fight do u ment in dressrosa ? <@606196171307745308>  i was taking about pica bc zoro had to use 3000 worlds thing  which is the most he did until now. I‚Äôm not sure if rengouku onigiri is stronger but I want to see more of zoro in wano
I wanna see blood in wano man
Mooore blood
I‚Äôm just hungry
Why does law want to beat kaido ? Did we know the goal of his plan
Idc who fights kaido as long as it‚Äôs a coordinated strategic fight and not just spamming strongest  attacks
^
Ussop heading straight for the numbers is hard
Why did Magellan say he‚Äôd protect doffy
That‚Äôs what I remember
Didn‚Äôt Magellan say he won‚Äôt allow the wg to interfere with his prisoners ? Or was that before he was demoted
Yeah but he has no power or authority now
Is he confirmed as a diff species
Yeah exactly that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm confused as to why the wg didn‚Äôt kill him already
Why risk the chance of him escaping
Why keep a loose end tho
Just kill him and that‚Äôs it
If kaido wanted to get doffy back he can probably break in and take him right
Yeah but there has to be reason not to kill doffy. Otherwise a yonkou can break in and free him for whatever purpose
Doffy was speculating
The wg seems to need doffy for smth
> <@564773067969265674>  why do you say that <@!206896898215378945>  bc they‚Äôve kept him alive all this time when he‚Äôs a major threat
If I was the wg I‚Äôd kill doffy immediately and not risk it unless I need him later. It just how I see it
Didn‚Äôt bb make level 6 prisoners fight each other to join his crew ? So there shouldn‚Äôt be anyone other than doffy down there
Why wouldn‚Äôt they want to join bb and be free
Do fleet admirals know stuff about the void century or does the wg keep them after retirement for marine related knowledge
Yeah it‚Äôs probably bc they know of god valley and such stuff
I doubt the wg will tell marines anything about the void century even the fleet admirals
Akainu got the job at the worst possible time lmao
Akainu has a lot of hair to deal with rn
Marines seem to want to make moves
The warlords are gone so the wg wants the yonkou gone too apparently
Is it confirmed that ssg has to do with wapometal
Smiles are useless imo
Smile cyborgs would be funny more than anything
But it‚Äôs a risk. Look at sanji and reiju
Having some capacity for thinking would be better than just robot go kill brrrr
^
Hey bean what do you think is better, sanji bs page1 in the manga or anime and why
I meant vs lmao
The anime is weird sometimes look at luffy vs doffy for example
Boruto is all anime canon lmao
The manga is decent
Isn‚Äôt that all of us
Is the law novel illustrated or not
Yeah
I wanna see vid valley movie
> <@564773067969265674> what <@606196171307745308>  yeah the manga is 60 chapters or smth and the anime is 170 episodes
> <@564773067969265674> its just sad how good the manga is and how shit the anime <@606196171307745308>  the manga is okay but the anime turned into slice of life which I can understand but it‚Äôs a big change
Vegito with the facts
I‚Äôll read the page gimme a sec
It‚Äôs just talking about the history of the treasure and how garp defeated jao and broke his heart so he left the empire
And how garp was considered the hero of the marines
I goofed up big time in 987 tho
I mistook „ÅÇ„Çåfor „Åä„Çåbc the font was not clear. So I basically translated they as we
My pleasure guys
The title they choose was not what the Japanese said but they probably have their reasons
In Japan it‚Äôs Sunday too unless there‚Äôs a holiday
But we get raws on Thursday and clean scans and Friday
Shop owners or delivery drivers snatch a copy and leak the chapter
You need connections with someone in Japan to get leaks tho
It‚Äôs not illegal rather shady according to artur
The leaks have to come from Japan but the one who posts them can be Korean
^
Are you calling zeph dumb stoopid
Damn
I find it weird that some youtubers released reviews last week even before the French scans were out
Bda law and joyboy
Bda is decent
Yeah he‚Äôs really into levels
Glr is my go to rn
Joyboy thought the traitor was the sheep in zou lmao
Bda law and glr had a debate about power scaling. It was good
There was no winner vegito. Both had good points
Show us your meditation stoopid
There was no beef lmao
Every YouTuber has their big oof moments
Some more than others
Are Ohara‚Äôs reviews good. I heard he reviews the Japanese now
No
It‚Äôs not a big deal
Yea me too coded
Roger base had a video with girls in nami and robin cosplay. Too much skin, it was creepy
No I mean the atmosphere of the video not the cosplay lmao
Tekking is chill I love him
Tekking is like your friend who loves op
I love tekking‚Äôs streams he‚Äôs very chill there
I don‚Äôt feel that way about him zeph
He just seems like a 14 yo op mega fan
Bda law sketches are cringy af
What I love about tekking is that he doesn‚Äôt stay on topic
Tekking ranking boobs was amazing
> oh , that skit guy <@328936254978916352>  bda does skits now
They cringy af bro
Yeah I‚Äôll give him that
Btw who watches those text youtubers ? Like wtf and it‚Äôs all shit theories anyway
Why would I watch a video of text tho
What do you guys think of nux
Mix is amazing on the podcast but his vids are trash
The op virgin is the only thing I follow rn
Watch the op virgin bean you‚Äôll love it
Does artur live in Japan ?
Artur is German iirc
Briggs loves op but his vida aren‚Äôt great imo
Damn there‚Äôs a lot of op YouTubers
Post marineford is a lot in its own
Yeah mark was with nux in the podcast yesterday zeph
Nux is really chill in the podcast
Nux is a mega fan of op but he‚Äôs weird too weird
Anime uproar have decent op reviews
Yeah I know
Is gozen not like animak
Who watches the anime man ? He is decent imo
Anime man is all over the place
There‚Äôs an anime pachinko wtf
Op and HxH are the best mangas I‚Äôve read
Exactly kamui
Yeah I loved the endings
The VAs are all top tier in op
The guests arriving at wholcake chateau was way better in the anime with the music
Animation in wano has been generally better but the pacing tho
Remember luffy vs urashima
Queen OST is fire
> <@!703504844903940096> I went to my local book store and read thriller bark @Kamui.#3859  I first saw the Arabic dub and the opening was them saying one piece over and over lmao
Batman is yonkou level
What lazy
Kata and queen music are the best recent stuff
Overtaken us the shit
Judging by queen then king should have a good ost
I‚Äôm too focused on the action so I don‚Äôt notice the music
What is that pos
Who wrote it
Bye coded
Is that from op joker
I think it‚Äôs an old symphony
What arc
> ohbutwhydontthemarineskilltheemperorstholul <@!114296407816404992>  wtf bean
Ok I‚Äôm too dumb
But they were the victors
If The marines are going after the yonkou then that‚Äôs a bold move
So we know how Bonney escaped the marines after bb captured her
Why would garp help her
Oh yeah
She was chained with sea prism right ?
I want to see more Bonney she seems really interesting
Wtf is happening lmao
Bonney, Kidd and drake are the only supernova who seem interesting rn
The rest are meh
Why would I care about uroge
Law is a given lol
Drake is really interesting rn bc ssg and kaido and the war
That‚Äôs how you know he‚Äôs gonna be good
We don‚Äôt know
I wanna see if drake will take the side of the sh
Break bro
Kaido doesn‚Äôt need intelligence groups to know what the marines think. The abolished the warlords and it was in the newspapers
^
It‚Äôs obvious tho. The marines won‚Äôt abolish a force that keeps the balance without having some thing else
What would caribou benefit from telling bm that
Caribou is an idiot so I can see him doing it ngl
Yeah he should be able to
Lmao
Do you think kanjuro told orochi or kaido about the road poneglyph in zou
Kanjuro is an weird place. He‚Äôs obviously a traitor but he‚Äôs not doing his best for orochi either
He‚Äôs not loyal but I‚Äôd say confused
True
Kanjuro is becoming more interesting
They went to dresseosa bc of the call they got
It‚Äôs basically whatever luffy wants to do
Roger laughed bc they were too early
Roger thought he had to be quicker but he was 25 years early lol
They learned both the history and the ‚Äú prophecy‚Äù
Why
I see your point, but I trust oda
plot cage ?
Elaborate more mochi
Fujitora was the only one who could stop doffy by going after him but he trusted luffy so I do t see the problem
> NGL I think oda gave some major plot armor to doffy with the bird cage. It conveniently put some of the strongest fighters in dressrosa at the time to defending against it, so that luffy could fight doffy without zoro or others coming to his help. <@!182986298687094785>  the crew doesn‚Äôt interfere with luffy‚Äôs fights anyway so...
> <@564773067969265674> the grand fleet at the time weren't part of the crew and all Hated doff. It gave them a convenient excuse to keep them away from the fight. <@!182986298687094785>  other than luffy sabo and Fuji who do you think could‚Äôve defeated doffy ?
Inherited haki doesn‚Äôt mean that they literally inherited from Oden but they learned how to use it bc there his retainers
> <@564773067969265674> solo? I don't think anyone other than those 3. But put up a decent fight against him? Most of the grand fleet captains can use haki and are pretty strong. There were 5-10 people in dressrosa that if they weren't blocked by birdcage could've helped luffy fight doflamingo. <@!182986298687094785>  just bc they use haki and can gang up on doffy doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôll win. Law and luffy teamed up and didn‚Äôt beat him. It took gear4 luffy two times to win
^
^
Rayleigh removing the collar from camie was adv armament right ? Just like luffy removing Yamato‚Äôs cuffs. So adv armament dies damage from the inside that‚Äôs how luffy and the scabbards can hurt kaido
If the scabbards use the lower form now can they pierce kaido ? Shouldn‚Äôt he be sent flying then ?
> wasn't it rokuougan? <@184025649646665728>  lucci just says it epically rokuuuuugan
> Scabbards didn't do that though <@!372464153480134666>  if they used what sentumaru used then kaido should‚Äôve been blown away not pierced
Bc it‚Äôs a shockwave more than damage
I see your point laww but I‚Äôm not convinced
If it‚Äôs the same as hyou then kaido wouldn‚Äôt have been pierced rather just damaged from the haki coating the sword
Right ?
Bc the haki coating the sword would‚Äôve damaged him from the inside rather than the outside
Again I understand what you‚Äôre saying but I disagree
Okay
If they used a mace
What would happen then
A mace is blunt just like the hand right. Then how would it pierce
Okay, Yamato‚Äôs weapon. What would it do
Okay laww so what luffy did to the tree is diff from what hyou did. Is that what you‚Äôre saying
I get it now. The panel juba posted explained it. The outcome of applying adv haki to a sword is diff than a fist
I was confused over the two applications of adv haki
> What did Katakuri's mold itself as? It could bypass Luffy's normal Armament like the form of it that seeps into an object, but it doesnt exactly destroy Luffy internally. <@!274366418223497217>  I think his armament was just stronger
Yeah zeph
It was harder
Was Fuji using normal observation ? It was just like ussop did. Or is it a higher level
Kata still dodged some attacks tho
Kata was amazing
I think she could sense people‚Äôs emotion
Shyarly just had a weird ability right
Shyraly just scans people
Not luffy
A man wearing a straw hat
Small brain cookie
I think laboon would be last
As the end of the journey
Foxy was really fun
Has anyone seen the luffy oyabun filler
It was amazing
Foxy comes back too
Really
I love how he says aho baka which both mean idiot lol
I need to rewatch that filler
It‚Äôs hilarious lmao
Robin feeding luffy in punk hazard was adorable
We need more sh interactions and comedy man
Marimo baka
Santoryu
Nitoryu
Yeah I goofed
<:Crydo:586275183032270849>
The French scans make kaido‚Äôs laugh wolololo
<:TamaHuh:735289165109002260>
Hey where can I read the colored chapters
Is it the zolo translation
Damn that was hilarious
Tobi roppo in the audience lmao
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
But really tho. If he was too early who‚Äôs didn‚Äôt he just jump forward in time
This was born here
The best server on the world
nah Just give up
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
Growing up without a father or someone who‚Äôs distant can cause issues
Not the conventional ‚Äù daddy issues‚Äù tho
How did germa make sanjis bounty alive only ? Did they pay morgans or was it bm‚Äôs connections
What‚Äôs confusing about the bounties is that akainu was surprised by luffy‚Äôs 1.5bil so who set it then
Sengoku told garp that if he wasn‚Äôt the hero of the marines then He woulda been held responsible for the actions of his family
That just goes to show how much of a threat rocks was
> wierd how Rocks was this huge threat, and yet he's been almost entirely erased from history <@491390898031296532>  that makes perfect sense actually
The marines might try to cut off the connection between their hero and dragon so the won‚Äôt tell people
The admirals must know but marine fodder def won‚Äôt
That was a gag
Marine fodder are totally useless
Yeah you can use fodder to flex coc
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
Sanji on the other hand
So an army of chickens isn‚Äôt chickens
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
I laughed too hard at that cookie thx bro
Are trying to say that trebol was a bad villain zeph
Mr5 is gladues lite
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
No
Long range
Ofc not chicken
Who‚Äôs that loser getting no diffed ichiji
You should not argue with Instagram people
What‚Äôs happening to joy boy ? He lost his hair completely
Not hair lol shit
His thumbnail art is good I‚Äôll give him that
It‚Äôs not his art lol
He pays an artist
His reviews are decent but his theories...<:WBDisgust:650047749831524372>
He thought the traitor was the sheep from zou <:TamaHuh:735289165109002260> wtf
Nah the big sheep nami slept on
His reasoning was the was ... after his speech and ida never uses ... unless there‚Äôs smth
<:TamaHuh:735289165109002260>
Chill fleeb
Bege let‚Äôs his infant son smoke a cigar. Best dad ever
Cigar bro get cultured
Fleeb I knew your points were useless but that‚Äôs too much
In the manga I think it‚Äôs a real cigar
Still funny either way
Yeah my bad then
How did bm go from bad to good to bad agian
Even her face changes lol
Oof
Did they color luffy vs kata
That would be dope
Probably mean mother
How old is pero
And bm
Close one
His father was the cook yeah
That dude is creepy
Did bm have peros with her in rocks as a crew member
Yeah but I‚Äôm wondering if peros was part of the crew too
Everyday we start further away from god
I think a a admiral could hold his own but a yonkou would win
Powerscaling here is smth else lmao
Caribou has a crescent moon in his beard. Caribou kouzuki confirmed
We haven‚Äôt seen ussop use haki since dressrosa so we don‚Äôt know
Ussop used observation just like Fuji
> Thats litterally what observation is <@434140622488862720>  I mean Fuji and ussop are the only one who can see silhouettes right ?
Yeah it could be
The official digital version isn‚Äôt the best quality for some reason wtf
How many times did you change your name today stoopid
Shot ofc
Red hair vivi would like bad
Would kiku look good with red hair
<a:usoppno:470029376348487701>
Op art is so good
Geeeee
>chambers
That scene with wb and the giant was so good in the anime
No new stuff
<:BoaGasm:701744981811134515>
> but doing a single chapter took like 4 hours <@272064319661801473>  <:TamaHuh:735289165109002260>
What are doing that take a4 hours
Oh you redraw, that takes a lot yeah
Really good work. How long does typesetting take you
How about me fleeb. I‚Äôm new so there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm on the list right
Mistakes like what
It takes some getting used to. Do you work on a pc
Stoop is newkama so no sruprise there
Stoop stop playing with us
Things are getting too weird
I‚Äôm scared
ReReread
Big time
It‚Äôs actually terrifying how fast the pace is
Orochi deserves to die that way ngl
Monet sacrificed herself for doffy‚Äôs sake. What cold heart
How‚Äôs the quality of the pages oj
> got myself the first edition volume and shonen mag from japan last year <@598085666538258432>  how‚Äôs the quality of the pages ? Is the print clear
How much was the volume
Don‚Äôt provoke me stoopid
I ordered 95 and 96 from Japan but was not sure about the quality
Since they‚Äôre only 440 yen
> I'm being honest <@!415999229564157955>  it‚Äôs nice to see acceptance of bird people
Why her and not Rebecca
<a:usoppno:470029376348487701>
Is kata mochi all the time like luffy is always rubber
So if you touch luffy he‚Äôs always rubber and can stretch then if I pull on kata do I get mochi
So that‚Äôs the only diff between logias and special paramicias
I just want to be clear
Bc if you touch akainu you won‚Äôt burn right
She has to maintain her beauty
Well mochi is rice so..
Why did oda go that route with it
Just call it a logia
<a:salt:469186979553083392>
How so
Bless me with your knowledge master
After all that time I‚Äôd you typing I was expecting more ngl
I gotta say
I‚Äôm disappointed stoopid
^

I‚Äôm a med student too. Doesn‚Äôt mean shit stoopid
Let me make it clear stoopid
If it were to come to a flexing match
You have no chance
See stoopid
You failed the test
Real strong people don‚Äôt flex
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
Pathetic
I listed 0 viruses
> Monet was the main character until she died <@!274366418223497217>  her death only made her more amazing
Nah stoopid
0 bc I have no need to prove anything
See stoopid
My goals are beyond your comprehension
If you stop I‚Äôll let you go this time
You lose either way stoopid
You‚Äôve already lost
You‚Äôre just too dumb to realize it
What if I‚Äôm you
Hesitation...
An obvious sign of weakness
See stoopid
See that
That‚Äôs 0.0000000001 of my power
I forgive u fats

How old is this server btw
Oof
<:akainuban:608389100583780353>
No You won‚Äôt fleeb
That‚Äôs early fats
I started watching in 2007
Hey <@!415999229564157955> I hope I didn‚Äôt go too far with the big brain jokes. It‚Äôs all in good fun buddy
What‚Äôs wrong with the Japanese fate
Stoopid, I have no time for tomfoolery
Lol fate
> Japanese volumes are interesting. I got one of a recent one since I went to Japan <@!274366418223497217>  what do you mean interesting ? Are they good or not
I will play with you more some other time stoopid
Volumes are like 5 $ stoopid
Stop stealing
That‚Äôs the one I ordered zeph. Now I‚Äôm more excited
You have money <:TamaHuh:735289165109002260>
True
Rice is a staple almost everywhere
20 cent ramen too
Am I the only one who likes plain pasta
Plain pasta is the best bro
In the pasta
Stoopid understands
I hate Parmesan
> Pasta, salt and maybe some oil and I'm good <@!415999229564157955>  exactly, and then I drink the water with all the pasta and sauce essence
Damn stoopid, you‚Äôre not so stoopid anymore
Yes stoopid
Stale bread too
Either is good
This server is woke
<:FujiWoke:638345772953370624>
Ok I have the real question
Ketchup on the fries or on the side
Wrong
The answer is Mayo
Do you make pickles at home  too stoopid
^
Homemade pickles are the best
> All pickeled food is disgusting <@471505711529197569>  I mean your name IS satan
Eat bee ass secretion
Real honey or super market honey, pasta ?
Strong roots
What other animal secretion do humans eat
Spider silk ?
Anyone
Yeah
I do
Anyone heard of the forbidden kiwi
In Japan they eat octopus mouth and live shrimp. Wtf
Who said it‚Äôs a corpse
Yeah so one piece
<a:NamiRunning:585643147086921737>
I‚Äôll be stealing that, thank you

I need to get a kiku wall scroll


Don‚Äôt we all

Get outta here


Op is amazing
^
Kiku can love you and protect you
Yeah
She‚Äôs badass
I‚Äôd like to know too root
How about monet
Zoro doesn‚Äôt care for love and women
He loves swords and booze
Zoro is beyond peasantly human urges and desires
We can get development without him dying
If his death has purpose then it can develop his character yeah, but, it‚Äôs not necessary
Oh sorry wow
> Nothing's Necessary it's a manga <@521783526878609418>  yeah but we judge what‚Äôs likely by looking at the story and how things can happen and develop without being an ass pull
What was bb going after in 956
Why would he go after warlords
He says that if the wg isn‚Äôt gonna claim it then he will
What is it though
I don‚Äôt see how abolishing the warlords can open up a chance for bb to get a poneglyph
True
Kata is a beast tho
Would be a nice fight
It makes sense yeah
I don‚Äôt think bb wants to blackmail the wg with doffy or the info he holds
Doffy is losing his shit down there
Yeah but he‚Äôs losing it even more lmao
A lot
Kidd luffy kaido bm
Who else
Did bb explicitly say he wants to be pk
Shanks shoulda moved on bb along time ago
Bb is getting more powerful by the day and it will be too much even for shanks
Is weevil really that strong
Kizaru seems to be exaggerating
He can‚Äôt be as strong as young wb
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
He did beat 16 wb captains tho
Gravity won‚Äôt stop light in op
> nah kizaru beats all of them cuz he my favorite <@!212265078739828737>  powerscaler logic lmao
Can kizaru add haki to his light projectiles
Wb didn‚Äôt kill akainu how can garp do it
Science is fun but it doesn‚Äôt work in op
Garp had a duty as a marine
They all die
Yeah but garp gets enough shit for the actions of his family already. Imagine what would happen if he saved ace
If Fuji can create a black hole then he automatically wins
> <@631190162566676480>  > Taking Ace as his grandson doesn't do against his entire lifes career <@521783526878609418>  he still left him to dadan to stay away from being connected to him in the eye of the public
So garp took his precautions
How
Barto can‚Äôt close it on himself completely
We saw it in dressrosa
There‚Äôs an area limit but maybe not strength in barto‚Äôs power
He can still be pushed tho
His barrier isn‚Äôt immovable too
^
Zeph is too woke for this pleb chat
Barto‚Äôs barrier deflects everything so probably kizaru‚Äôs attacks too
The energy from kizaru‚Äôs attack would probably heat up barto‚Äôs barrier but not penetrate it
If you want to apply real life science
Purple
How white ?
How can we have white fire tho
Hot boi
Microwave
If wapol eats bb does he get 3 df
Wapol eats himself
Can wapol eat a poneglyph
Just like buggy swallowing a pineapple
Buggy‚Äôs fruit is dope
He can fly and avoid cuts
Also has infinite lifting power when flying
If law cuts buggy in his room can buggy reattach
Buggy has to be cut with haki, nothing else works
Buggy gets pulled towards his feet
We see it in impel down
Zeph my brain too small, it hurts <:ViviPanic:738523407808856145>
They have their will but they‚Äôre linked to her
So if she does they die too
Vp can already feed objects df
Zeph bouta spit some facts
Yeah I get your point
Since they‚Äôre sentient they be better fighters
Zeph you should be an oda editor
He needs your knowledge
> metal metal fruit would be another natural counter to eneru and could possibly redirect his attacks <@598085666538258432>  or it would absorb all the damage lmao
^
Are you a science major zeph
Bc you like it or for op
I was kidding oj
It‚Äôs cool
I‚Äôve been here for 18 hours today
Insomnia go brrrrrr
Hey there strong
People can survive lightning tho
It‚Äôs nothing to be upset about. Op is a shonen not a science manga
I‚Äôve seen photos of people struck. By lightning who survived. It‚Äôs gnarly
Twice to croco boi
Lucci
Maybe your brain will charge fleeb
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
That‚Äôs part of why he‚Äôs a great protagonist
Everything is possible
Anime is there to make shot cool not to focus on the canon stuff bahamas. It‚Äôs made for the manga fans
Everyone in Japan reads the manga and the anime is made for them
Toei didn‚Äôt make money from western audience
Skypia was like a mini adventure outside the world. It was so fun
It introduced a nice culture and a nice history
Skypia I mean
Zou was build up for wano mostly
Yeah I know lol
<a:usoppno:470029376348487701>
All the op arcs are very dense in events and info except lrll maybe
We learned about the raid poneglyphs in zou, we met raizo, we met the monks, we saw jack and we learned the connection of the monks to the kouzuki
Zou was amazing
Damn you got me there
> Kinda impressive how laboon allowed crocus to just casually go inside him and build shit <@473457586234982410>  crocus had him on drugs bro
That‚Äôs a seal ? Thought it was a dirty rag ngl
Raizo has a big head
Big head = big brain
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
But seriously why do people give raizo shit
He‚Äôs amazing
Raizo played udon like a violin
Fuck caribu
Reverse imo card
I‚Äôll give it you this time
Ignore them bobo they just hating bc they‚Äôre losers
Caribu is lit dirt and water bro
Raizo is a ninja
Raizo is beyond such peasantly desires
Oda gives females unique designed but their faces look so similar
> Caribou is better at espionage and staying undercover than raizo <@!289876647354826752>  that‚Äôs why he was captured and sent to udon to be a slave
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
Raizo held my hand at night when I had a nightmare and made me feel better
He‚Äôs a ninja so he shouldn‚Äôt have tremendous power
Ninjas are stealthy
> Ninjas also can't disappear or have giant faces <@!289876647354826752> why discriminate against people with giant faces
Not cool bahamas
Oof
I never really liked anime games
They feel repetitive after a while
Yeah I get it, wano has been amazing
Imagine an open world op rpg with all the islands and characters
What
I don‚Äôt like smash so I can‚Äôt relate
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
I heard that world seeker was shit. Is that true
Who cares lol
I‚Äôll be stealing that alpha, ty
Break week is tough Bahamas
All op youtubers are def here under fake names most likely
Yeah but they would come here to check what people are saying about the chapters and such
Dude, now I have an image of a hairy bm in my head. Fuck
Thank you  pasta
Fleeb we all know you‚Äôve been lurking
Lafeet looks dope Bahamas
I just want bepo sulong <:Crydo:586275183032270849>
> i wonder if the mark is a tattoo or a mark like the slave and sun pirates mark <@!198930928083402753>  do you mean bc it‚Äôs diff than the small crescent moon that the others have ? I think denjiro is so dedicated that he got the full symbol tattooed on him
<@!198930928083402753>  it would be cool, but denjiro was the 2nd to join oden so why would he be a slave
Oh my bad, I thought you meant he was a slave when you said ‚Äúslave mark‚Äù.  But yeah that would be really badass
> also i think i broke my left ctrl <@!198930928083402753>  <:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
Use the right ctrl
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
I would love to play as Yamato
Who plays anything but the hardest diff Alex smh
Are the other characters paid
That‚Äôs just a scam.  How much for a character
How much is the game itself usually
Is the new one with wano characters on ps4 or 5
The changed ace to trace bc it was the name of some alcohol but they kept whiskey peak <:TamaHuh:735289165109002260>
Why would they skip skypia
The recent movies lack consequences for me. But gold was fun
Gold was hilarious and... sexy
Hand island was good for me
Yeah movie plots are not that great
Keep in mind that a movie is much shorter than the arcs of build up we get in op so it will certainly feel sub par in terms of plot. That‚Äôs why they have the best  animation
Film z was good in terms of plot
Ace‚Äôs alabasta face design was hilarious
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
Zoro doesn‚Äôt necessarily need to defeat mihawk to achieve his dream
It would be disappointing if he didn‚Äôt tho
We‚Äôve been waiting for this for years
He could achieve some feat to get the title
Exactly
It‚Äôs been anticipated for decades basically
Just like kaido wants to die
They‚Äôre that strong
I was shocked to see mihawk train him
But it developed zoro as character
Maybe zoro dies
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
If zoro dies fighting mihawk it would be the dumbest thing ever
Interesting by infuriating
As I always say
Trust oda
Why would mihawk join bb when bb is shanks‚Äô worst enemy
Bro mihawk left marineford when shanks arrived. He respects him
I can‚Äôt see mihawk jointing bb
Give me a valid reason vegito
That‚Äôs not valid
Why would mihawk help or join bb. Mihawk as a character has no reason to do that
Mihawk isn‚Äôt a coward
Even if bb could mihawk won‚Äôt join him
Marines can probably capture Rayleigh but they have more important stuff than a gambling old man
Yeah let‚Äôs leave powerscaling out of this convo please
There‚Äôs no reason for mihawk to join bb even if bb can defeat him or blackmail him somehow. Mihawk isn‚Äôt a coward and he probably doesn‚Äôt care if he dies
> Doubt 2 admirals can take mihawk <@96965684428283904>  bro you good <:TamaHuh:735289165109002260>
Sengoku didn‚Äôt fight jack iirc
But jack took down two of their four ships
People make jack look like he‚Äôs fodder. Give the man some credit
^
Jack fought for 5 days without sleep while his enemies slept and then he went after the marines and took down half of their ships. Dude is a monster
Did neko and inu fight jack in sulong ?
<@96965684428283904> he fought an admiral to take down the ships. And neko and inu couldn‚Äôt have been that much weaker thank jack. Especially combined
Exactly
If queen and king are stronger than jack then they will be amazing
^
I‚Äôm curious how luffy would compare to the scabbards rn
Did neko and inu use sulong against jack or not
Damn
Now I‚Äôm more excited for next chapter
^
It‚Äôs a joke
The fight with jack happened 2 weeks before the straw hats arrived. How long did it take from zou to wci ?
How long did the straw hats stay in wci
So it‚Äôs still kinda possible that neko and inu uaed sulong against jack. Bc the fight happened two weeks before the sh arrived and then they went to the wci which took about a week and stayed they‚Äôre for a few days until the fool moon
Unless neko and inu missed the full moon by a couple of days
If inu said that then I can‚Äôt argue with it
Yeah sulong neko and inu seem to be monsters lit
Neko and inu can do some damage to kaido then. Damn. Ofc they won‚Äôt beat him tho
Kaido will at some point
<@!274366418223497217>  what‚Äôs the problem there ? He had a whole day to think about his choices and he learned more info too
He will
<@!274366418223497217> it was a short time but a lot of shot happened. I‚Äôm okay with it
Zoro is such a bully ngl
Fair enough
Where do you find that shit vegito
Sup being friends with them
<a:usoppno:470029376348487701>
Is that Monet slander I hear
This is best girl

Don‚Äôt lie to yourselves
Oof
Is this your first watch through ziphy
How do you like it compared to the manga
Really
Are you watching the original or on one pace
I started with the anime but I find the manga more enjoyable
I still watch the anime bc it‚Äôs fun tho
The server is brutal today damn
He just does
His name is king the wild fire so it should have a reason
no Stop
> Also just got a new gif if anyone wants to cop <@532302418210193411>  I‚Äôll be taking that, thank you very much
77
825-902
Does 902 count in
Oh yeah my bad
Yeah 902 is included
How long do you guys think wano will go
Yeah I‚Äôd give it another year
If it‚Äôs 5 acts
The 5th should be like post wano
Very short
He had no problem in romance dawn
Should be nothing
Amaeeing their families would be a good reason to go
You know what I mean
No need to make me sad
<:Crydo:586275183032270849>
Damn the theories that come outta this server are...
Buggy was born with his nose
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
Wow discrimination against red nose people I‚Äôm speechless
Fleeb not cool

Gee
> mugiwara no ichibi <@727466656116506744>  ichimi
The real question is how will momo‚Äôs dragon form get into play
I am surprised as to how many people ask about the break when it says right in the chapter
Are there any people here reading from day one
I doubt it
When did you guys start
Halter 1 was in 1997
I started in 2011
With the anime
Damn cookie
Op is ancient lmao
Oda spent all his life on op
Oda is doing a service for the world
We‚Äôre all disappointed in ourselves
I think with kaido it refers to how tough he is and not just his strength
Yeah
Squardo was able to stab wb
But he can‚Äôt stab kaido
Yeah
Wb in terms of raw power
But kaido is a combination of power and toughness
Wb could‚Äôve used haki obviously but squardo can‚Äôt stab kaido anyways
Not to mention that wb just took the hit
To show squardo how he loves him
Wdym zeph
> Really I'm hoping its explained how Kaido can be the strongest in the sea (like in the water). Not necessarily strength against aquatic creatures but in combat down there <@334119106959769610>  it just probably means that he is the strongest among all creatures not in all environments
If Marco said that then I can‚Äôt argue
Kureha celestial dragon confirmed
How much did kureha know anyway
I doubt she knows the true history
Roger was called by his real name then they changed it once he became too dangerous iirc
He tells wb ‚Äúdo you know what they call me these days‚Äù
<:FujiWoke:638345772953370624>
Who makes these things
Lmao it‚Äôs in the name
Funniest shit I‚Äôve ever seen ngl
I mean at least they‚Äôre honest about their headcanon
They‚Äôre probably trolls
No horny plz
Don‚Äôt tell lies
Food
<:akainuban:608389100583780353>
The hardest part of break week is how dead this server is
<:Crydo:586275183032270849>
Isn‚Äôt your powerscaling headcanon too
Nah one kiku is beautiful and strong enough
Who doesn‚Äôt simp kiku
<:FujiWoke:638345772953370624>
Rabbit and carrot in one dish
Nice
<:FujiWoke:638345772953370624>
I‚Äôd rather not
Lmao
Homemade burgers are the best
It‚Äôs just meat in a pan gaben
How can you fuck it up
Lmao
I don‚Äôt like where this is going
Gaben what‚Äôs wrong with you
Add more potato ?
I feel you gaben
Where did you get those carrot gifs gaben. I need them
Give me it.  now
Short hair is always best
Carrot knows what‚Äôs up
He‚Äôs a savage
<a:fastcarrotlaugh:740450178607349780>
Paulie who got beat by hattori
<a:EvilHattori:641498690279702542>
There‚Äôs  no chapter I swear
Like in 6 days
Yeah soon
<:Crydo:586275183032270849>
Is Monet an animal
<a:NamiRunning:585643147086921737>
Pirate them then
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
Is that alcohol
Damn hattori has issues
That‚Äôs legit cool

This is my favorite
Edo era art is the best

Lmao
Guys you‚Äôre forgetting the best outfit in op

Doesn‚Äôt t sanji look cute
^

Oda is a genius
They can‚Äôt use their power if they‚Äôre cuffed by seastone coded
What ? When did luffy so that
Bege used a seastone spear on Cesar in zou and he couldn‚Äôt use his power
> oh I mean isnt sea stone and sea supposed to have the same effect <@703504844903940096>  seastone is like the concentrated essence of the sea
Sea water is weaker than seastone bc seastone is the essence of the sea water than nullifies the devil fruit power
<@!415999229564157955> yeah the marines can do that bc seastone is part of the sea that‚Äôs why it has the same effect, but I would imagine that seastone is some kind of mineral or salt that is part of the sea water that is then used in a higher concentration so it has a stronger effect
Sea clouds ?
Technically yeah
Hopefully we see all the sh shine
The only one who shines in wci was turkey brook
Brook needs some turkey meat
Too weird
But he liked it
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
This needs to stop ASAP
Mods please help I‚Äôm scared
We need a chapter ASAP the server is getting outta control rn
<a:usoppno:470029376348487701>
^
I can see sabo fighting akainu since the revolutionaries are going after the wg so akainu could step in, but I don‚Äôt see it happening for the grudge or such
Ace and luffy are both pirates. It was his job
Spandam went ok at overboard with his job ngl
Well momo is really growing lately thanks to luffy so I‚Äôm actually loving him rn
Luffy telling momo to speak for him self instead of relying on his retainers was amazing
Stoop focusing on what really matters in op
Two breaks in a row is too much
Chapter break chapter break so technically yeah
At least we get 3 chapters now
Knocks on woods
Oda didn‚Äôt take breaks in the first 5 years only iirc
Then he was forced to
We lose either way then.  Thx stoopid
Bro I cried when roger laughed
I was scared
My anxiety is through the roof rn knowing the end is near
Taste probably. I for example don‚Äôt like slice of life anime no matter how good it is
I can see the world go into chaos when op ends
Some people will react in some weird ways
Oof
You need a new psychiatrist due
Op will def get new readers after it ends. I mean look at cowboy bebop
How would you even make real life poneglyphs
<@!383464767421153290> I‚Äôm no psychiatrist, but I don‚Äôt think that telling you not to kill yourself bc you wound be able to watch the shows you like isn‚Äôt good advice. I think they should focus on the core problems. Agian I‚Äôm no psychiatrist so my opinion is not valid and this isn‚Äôt the place to talk about it anyway.  Hope you get better, I feel you bro
I was attacked by a goose once
Little piece of shit is strong
I don‚Äôt even know how to escape a goose ffs
Let‚Äôs see you grabbing it‚Äôs neck when it‚Äôs attacking you. They‚Äôre vicious
Wings beaks and their weight
They‚Äôre fucking monsters
Peacock df would be useless. They can‚Äôt even fly
You would look beautiful tho
Flashback to peacock looking Phoenix tattoos
No plz stop
No cockroach
