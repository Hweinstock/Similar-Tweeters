I don't get it
Damn that's crazy
You know what else is crazy?
People thinking Carrot is a better candidate for a strawhat member than Yamato
Captain Crunch is like eating knives
I like having not a bloody mouth
How old his sister's tho 👀
My dog Sanji out here
Can't beat black beard so just clap his sisters in God 😔🙏
On*
Dogs are cool
I have a husky
Yeah actually
Except it's spelled Maverick
Uh that depends tbh
I'm an actual pretty high class chef so Sanji sick but I also love Zoro
And sabo epic
Yeah it ain't easy
You know who's not my favorite tho?
Carrot 😐
Yamato > Carrot
I would've liked Carrot if she had more personality and was actually intriguing
Not saying she's a bad character
In fact I think she's one of the best side characters introduced in the mink arc
But as a strawhat to me she'd be the weakest strawhat character wise
> I find that Shirahoshi has the power to command the Sea Kings. Momo has apparently the power to command Zunesha. Luffy is probably only able to hear the creatures speak, and hear the voices coming from the Poneglyphs. He may not understand what they are saying, but he can feel their pain and their hopes, fears, angers, joy, etc. At least, that's what i assume. <@526953063089438720>   I genuinely don't know why if this is true he couldn't hear the poneglyphs before
If Roger who also had the voices of all things could do it why couldn't Luffy
> Carrot has a lot of personality wtf <@203091600283271169>  compared to other side characters yeah, compared to other strawhats not at all
> I mean she has proven her usefulness. Carrot joining still sounds way better than a helpless 8 year old Tama joining. Who’d probably just get kidnaped by some low tier pirate <@142923564423577601>  I agree, I don't think she's a terrible edition to the crew but she's had such little exposition of her character
> <@!521783526878609418> He probably activated it later on, during the two year timeskip. I guess it must have been a hidden power of his but it only came to surface recently. <@526953063089438720>  The truth is probably Oda came up with it later on but yeah that would be a good way for Oda to work around him not writing it in earlier
> I never understood why people dont want carrot and jimbe as straw hats <@203091600283271169>  Nah I'm not a carrot hater but it seems like Oda just hasn't done enough for her to join the crew tbh
I want her to join just to have other races
> <@521783526878609418> reread WCI <@203091600283271169>  She played as much a roll in WCI as any other side character in every other arc
The gladiator homeboy in dressrosa did more but he ain't joining
Being friends with two characters doesn't make them a crew member
Im not against her joining
I'm against her joining as she is now with little character and almost actual substance to her
I think it'd be super cool to have a mink
> I wonder what Robin and Carrot's dynamic would be <@153273023456083969>  Big sis vibes prob
> Robin big sister maybe <@419608704418054157>  Yup
> I think she's got enough interaction with the WCI strawhats, enough moments and all, and ofc the Pedro situation that I'd be fine with her joining, and there's still room for more in Onigashima <@372464153480134666>  Exactly I'm hoping Oda make Sher integral in Onigashima as so many people are attached to her already that it'd be better for the community if he just did something to make her a better fit then leave her as she is and not put her on the crew
> <@!521783526878609418> It is possible Oda had the whole concept of Haki planted in his head for some time. When Shanks gave that sea king a glare, the sea king backed off. It is highly possible, that he wanted to introduce it, but it was too early for that. Because the concept was heavily focused on Devil Fruits, and how obscure and dangerous DF users were at the time. <@526953063089438720>  Oh my bad I should've specified, I think Oda thought of haki since early on I meant the voices of all things
My bad
Peros a good big mom commander I like him enough
Power? Robin
She straight up assassinated people for a long time
> Aside from nami who do you think is closer with robin? <@142923564423577601>  Franky
Yeah for sure but I'm just saying in a 1v1 Robin would kill Nami
LMAO
Global warming jokes
And is Robin has Zeus Idk is she's the weakest if we talking straight power output
If* Nami*
Lmao my bad
I think she has to see where she's putting them no?
One piece best waifu? Bruh that's tuff
Yamato cool
Town boy type vibes
Rebecca tho
Vivi annoying sometimes not about it
Strawhats closest to Luffy are Nami and Zoro then Ussop and Sanji
Not closest but know him the best ig
Thatd be able to read his mind the best ig
Monet as annoying as Vivi without any of the good
Tashigi the goat
Yeah sometimes
At least to me
Being a crybaby
Exactly
How can the same person who literally became a double agent in a criminal organization be a so childish later
Not saying I don't like her because there's a lot of good
> If she was a male nobody would mind it <@683663101186277416> this just isn't true at all
At least for me she isn't my favorite at all and it has nothing to do with her gender or race as I love Yamato and would love a mink on the crew
Most strawhats have an entire arc while Carrot has just been a side character
> Well thats you alex. Alot of people don't feel that way <@683663101186277416>  A bunch of people in this chat felt the same way when we just talked about it like 15 minutes ago
Why people want obviously side characters to join I'm confused
> But her arc isn't over yet and she's a part of this war <@190325050593902593>  Yeah like I said earlier I really hope Oda makes her relevant now that the minks are going solung because I genuinely want a minks on the crew
I hope Oda does something to make her SH material cause rn she just isn't when compared to literally every other strawhat
> Carrot put in a lot of work in WCI, more than practically any "just side characters" <@534844218376585227>  What'd she do besides use her sulang and be just a living creature on the sunny?
She has done no wear near as much as every other strawhat has done before joining
Fuck u right she helped her change nvm
Pedro would've been cooler just because of the hisorey
> So she has to do more work than all of the other strawhats who's had more time in the crew than her?<@521783526878609418> <@683663101186277416>  No she hasn't done no wear near as much work as any of the straw hats before joining the crew
Every strawhat has had an entire arc for them
Carrot is has been in the story for literally years now
> isn't over <@372464153480134666>  Ik and Ive said multiple times I hope she becomes more relevant
But literally replace Carrot with any other female mink and the same shit would've happened she isn't unique in any way, every other strawhat is completely unlike anyone else
You > Carrot did more than zoro amd nami did when they tried to join the crew <@683663101186277416> Nami had an entire arc later on and Zoro was before one piece wasn't even like confirmed at all to be an ongoing show we had stories in 1 episode back then
> Replace zoro with any other sword fighter he isn't unique in any way <@683663101186277416>  No that's just incorrect, how many swords man do we meet that wanna be the best in the world and beat mihawk?
How many use 3 swords?
Saying Zoro is like every other swordsman literally makes no sense
If you truly think every character in the show is generic and unsoecial then downtbwatch the show
No it's not because one is a main character and one is a side character
Except it does when any other female mink who is trained in sulong could've done what she did
Carrot pretty much exactly like that other dog mink
What? I'm saying any female mink who has sulong could've donenwhat she did in WCI
Do you think any swordsman could've done what Zoro has done?
Not any but obviously any that have trained in it
But not any strong swordsman has the personality traits that Zoro does
Literally all the female minks are the same.thing
Bruh
That dog mink legit was just carrot but as a dog
Carrot is generic
> This is kinda bordering sexism wtf <@190325050593902593>  Nah I have no problem with a female Mink as long as they have an actual personality
> Whats a personality to you then <@190325050593902593>  Specifically for the straw hats? A dream ig
Wanting to just travel isnt an actual compelling dream bro
She likes jelly beans?  You right bro she gonna join the crew 😔
Look I have nothing against Carrot as a character
> What's chopper's dream? <@683663101186277416>  Wanting to create a medicine that cures everything
Have u not seen the show?
> their only similarity is garchu which is a similarity among every mink <@372464153480134666>  But one the only trait a character has is that they're cute it's not an actual personality
> Damn Brook's dream is to see Laboon again? Thats not compelling at all <@683663101186277416>  Are you a clown? Homie lost his entire crew
> <@521783526878609418>  are you caught up to the manga lol? <@477218487903977483>  Yeah bro Imk what carrot has done in wano
Jack shit
> What has robin done in wano <@190325050593902593>  > She's about to <@662544074015899649>  And like I said earlier I truly hope so as like we can see here so many people want her to join
> Do you see how that dream argument falls apart then? <@521783526878609418> <@683663101186277416>  Nothing's falling apart lmao you're just saying a characters dreams aren't compelling when they are
> Alex check what I said about what her dream can be it's not just adventuring <@662544074015899649>  Where?
I genuinely want her to do something cool to join the crew
But the fact that she just us alive and hasn't done anything heart moving or anything is pretty obvious that shes a side character
Is*
At the end of the day bro this is all just opinion right?
We won't know for sure until something does or doesn't happen
Yeah except they've all already had an arc to themselves bud
> Well it is a fact that she has a dream and it is a fact that she has done alot <@683663101186277416>  "Alot" yeah ight
> For carrot, it can be to help the strawhats bring about the dawn which is Pedro's last words to her <@662544074015899649>  You see that would be fucking amazing! But guess what it hasn't happened yet
> Nah you made a claim she did nothing heart moving and that it made it obvious she was a side character. Those are claims about the story, not just opinions <@415999229564157955>  Nah, in my opinion she hasn't done anything heart moving
> Again she has done more than what nami and zoro did when they first joined the crew<@521783526878609418> <@683663101186277416>  Except literally 2 arcs later Nami got her own arc
Carrot been in the crew for legit 2 years now real time and she ain't do shit
> So would you have doubted Nami joining as much before those two arcs? <@372464153480134666>  Imagine comparing an anime establishing itself to an anime 20 years later that has the ability to do pretty much anything Oda wants
If Oda wanted to make carrot a straw hat he would've
She cried when someone died? Damn bro you right she's the best character
Why didn't he focus on her during the mink arx?
You crying at a death isn't development bro
Breaking down infront of Luffy asking for help is development
Look how about we wait and see if she joins
If you're right I'll admit I'm wrong
If I'm right you all can admit you're wrong
> It's being open to her joining <@662544074015899649>  You just ignoring everything I've said about me wanting her to join?
Im plenty open with her joining in my opinion she just needs more development to fit in with the crew
> So forgive me for jumping to conclusions <@662544074015899649>  It's chill no one here mad or anything we all one piece fans at the end of the day
We all trust Oda
On God
Literally asked to join before Luffy could invite her
Homes I'm moving on I've already stated my opinion
You're welcome to have yours
Ok bud
You're right it's an assumption on something that isn't clearly stated
It's the way you are perceiving Odas work
I have the right to perceive it any way I want
That's how art works 😀
Until Oda comes out and says yes or no to her joining we can all just make assumptions and opinions on  what we got
W
Now then let's get to the real important stuff
Who's gonna get the last hit on Kaido?
Frost you are built different
What if kaido is actually that fat form we saw in the beginning of one piece
Idk how I feel about that theory
And the form we see is his hybrid
The only reason I even consider the theory is to point out how far Oda thinks into the future
Yeah
Ik but stfu
We can't let others know
Oda God he's known everything since chapter 1 trust
It was to show how he's a double crossing two face
See on purpose
On purpose bro
It was a hint
Na Na Oda a god trust
Yo some Sanjitard tried telling me sanni 1000× stronger than Zoro cause Zoro got knocked out by killer
> Why are the people that do nothing but shit on one piece and the people that do nothing but praise Oda  at every thing the same level of annoying <@248949219564584962>  I was being sarcastic bud
Imagine not understanding sarcasm
> oda doesnt miss <@161561601944584195>  He just built different
Ig but when it's that obvious 👀
> <@!521783526878609418> You know there are people who simply can't, I hope <@415999229564157955>  Yeah my brothers autistic got it
I said trust at the end I thought that was pretty indicative of a joke
It's chill
No one should be mad at anyone here
We all one piece fans
> One piece is dumb and ugly and I hate it <@272064319661801473>  Same
Like why's it so long
If you like the minks or fishman you a disgusting furry gross, and devil fruit? Is that like bad Naruto jitsu's or something
Dummies
Just waiting for the day Luffy reveals his genius to us all
Morgan saw it why can't we 😔
Fifth yonko who?
Ight can I start an actual debate tho?
Why people think the admirals are stronger than Yonkos?
Lmao my bad I was giving you guys a prompt
Have had it
Because I genuinely can't understand why people think they stronger in a 1 v 1
Homies saw a dying white beard die and went damn ig the yonkos are vice admiral level Max 🤷‍♂️
Connected to machines to be able to live day to day, dies to admirals, YO YONKOS WEAK
I can't understand if Kin'emon is strong or not
It hurts my mind
Yeah that's why
But also why didn't he fight back throughout the whole dressrosa thing
Yeah but that's also the man who legit ruined his entire life
Well
Admirals are closer than the rest
I agree titles don't equal level
But I'd say admiral is the closest thing to a set level we have
> all yonko stand a good chance agaisnt other yonko. All admials have a good chancce against each other <@380840459641159683>  Yeah for me Yonko and Admiral are the only 2 groups that within each could theoretically even each other out for a while admiral vs admiral or yonko vs yonko
People be saying 3 yonko commander like that should mean something
3 pirate king crew seat 4 edition fat cock level
No
1 v 1
No
Yeah
Same with doofy
But none of those characters 1 shot him instantly while in gear fourth
Kaido a monster
Bro 5 that's a lot
We need 2 life on the sunny chapters
I think if Luffy now went up against katakuri he'd beat him for sure
The first time not so much
But I won't dispute he won
So like half baths
Binge watch the whole show in 3 days
I had a friend in middle school who didn't leave his room for a month and binged it, he was a momma's boy tho so she did everything for him so he could do that easily
This was back in early dressrosa
Or even before can't really remember
But shit was crazy
Mans bathroom was connected to his room so he could shit while watching
Props to the boy Kevin he was a legend
Hey guys starting Marineford arc can't wait for Luffy to save Ace
Maybe he'll even join the crew to help get them back together that'd be sick
I wonder how good Moria is with his Devil fruit
Depending on how good he is with it will decide if Blackbeard lets him live or not
Considering how much time he's had it tho he's probably good with it
Wapol a business man <:NamiMoney:586664755536724030>
Wapol IS rich
It's true I was is
No piece
Let me tell y'all how Monkey Dragon is actually
Luffys dad
Nah people always confuse it
His name isn't monkey d dragon
It's monkey d ragon
Be D po
San D ji is so cool
Quaran D tine
Oohh my bad
Fuck is there a break?
Bruh
O d. a
Omg Oda you sick bastard
Sa d.
Y'all should read kingdom
I'm sure ik at some point and just forgot
It says it at the end of the chapter
No the anime is bad please God no don't watch it
The manga of kingdom is amazing
The anime is hot garbage
I agree it's amazing
The snow is gonna be such a nice touch when it's animated
Wait aren't Dragons weak to snow?
Oda loves Pokemon it's a hint omg
> <@!521783526878609418> Since when? <@162731766799532032>  I'm Pokemon Dragon types are weak to ice types
Yes
Editor a lil bitch that's why he cried
I bet I could 1v1 him real life shit
Bruh even better that was like last year
The editor is only 1 year old
I could fight a baby easy
Dumb ass baby of course he cried
He's a baby
Babies cry guys relax not his fault
Idek who Mr. Morj is
Is that a YouTuber?
I only watch Tekking101 and Totallynotmark
Idk him but he sounds kinda crazy
The brick is a lil much but I still like his content like towards the middle of the videos
Just skip pass the beginning lmao
I'm so excited for the next totally not mark video
It's like reliving one piece all over again
I love it
Why people hate Zoro besides Oda not always using him to his fullest is beyong me
Like yeah he's usually just there to fight the second in command and that's about it but who cares
Nah sanjitards hate him
I like em both
LMAO
Good point
Sanji can be a lil too much but his core character is good
Wdym
He literally risked his life for Luffy
I think it is cool
Yeah gin is awesome
Wish he came back as part of a yonko crew or something
Nah Zoro nothing happened still the most impactful for me tbh
How many living creatures have the will power to go through that for another human without dying
He has a bunch of amazing scenes
Daz bones was an amazing early one
The one moment that I think when u look at it in hindsight is as crazy is Arlong looking at Zoros wounds
That moment gives me goosebumps still
Arlong puking
How do I use these bots
!oda
I see
Gin was best antogonist before arlong
Lmao he's a cool character
I hope he comes into play in the final war
He gets last hit on kaido
Yes
Nah bro he has an iron clad will
<:GinCry:586660443775565854>
I agree
Oda doesn't just kill off characters unless it's important
Yeah but the hormones still had like a 5% survival rate or something
Gin just wants food
Shim you ok buddy?
Wapol is yonko level tbh
Like whose gonna stop wapol?
It didn't work he still alive
He'll just eat bb darkness
Eat usopps shots
He's obviously indestructible
Literally probably one of the richest none celestial humans
Apoo is yonko level easy
Roger died to apoo tbh we didn't see it so maybe
It's ok Mike
We can we all love One piece here that's the only language we need
Speak through emojis
<:WBeardWhat:638862189771620372>
<:ZoroNut:632474447462400010>
<:ZoroWeary:701983967041159169>
I only speak Spanish and french
And English
Ace so cool
Can't wait to see him again
> It never makes sense to me why people who aren't caught up with the series hang out here <@287712421165137920>  Nah I was just joking in the general chat I've read every chapter 💀
Nah Mike he means me
LMAO yeah
Thanks for being an actually good guy tho Strong right
I was waiting for the donut jokes but I actually were a good person
Lmao u a legend strong right
One piece my favorite manga my #2 was bnha but that shit fell off
Y'all should read kingdom it's really good just long
So if u want something long like one piece
Go read that
Same
I'm a real life Florida man
Well Miami boy so a lil difficult
> Damn. ||someone who started one piece that wasn't spoiled on that gigantic moment is like a unicorn|| Marineford spoiler <@287712421165137920>  Lmao u a legend man thanks for trying to not have me spoiled 🙏
Also yeah Ive been watching since early elementary school and before maybe so I can't remember if I was even spoiled back then
Like I just graduated high school and I've been watching one piece since like my earliest memory
Yeah I can't remember if ik or not
I might've been spoiled but idk for sure lol
I remember I thought that Arlong was a warlord in 6th grade for some reason
Im getting a one piece tattoo
I'm in between strawhat logo or the sun pirate tattoo
Yeah that's what I'm thinking
Or maybe both tbh
Lmao idky but a back tattoo sounds so scary to me
I'ma only do chest tats
Ig cause I can't see what's happening
Yeah Law was my fave character during my edgy 7nth grade phase
Wait this is general let me now say stuff
How can I do that spoiler block thing?
| like this? |
Nah that didn't work
Ooo
||pizza||
Let's goo ight
|| after punk hazard law has slowly become more and more of just another side character which is super sad because he's awesome ||
|| It seems like Oda has decided he's served his purpose pretty much ||
He's basically the catalyst of the entire yonko saga
Kanjuro knocked out
Gone
Slep
Slump
Shleep
So you think Oda knew since the intro of him that he was the traitor?
For sure wasn't there some evidence people found?
Yeah
I wonder how far ahead he planned certain concepts
Like you think he thought about yonko since day one?
I mean from intro to traitor is like 2 arcs that's not that far ahead
But from chapter one to yonko introduction
Or to haki
Or to imsama
You think he knew about imsama since romance dawn?
I doubt at first he has planned even the new world during romance dawn
Had*
Idk the way characters know about the grandline but no one mentioned the new world at all until thrillerbark?
Yeah when writing a manga you can't write it like it's gonna last 900 chapters
He wrote the manga not knowing how long it would last
Obviously now he can think as far into the future as he wants
Dr. Stone got slow for me when they got to that other island
Yeah now I think he has the liberty to think that far into the future
But at first he literally didn't know if he would reach passed 100 chapters
What? The log pose route was in paradise tho
I don't really think so
Yeah because that was chapter 100 and it's rare for mangas to get passed 100
Compare the amount of manga that are started versus the amount that make it
Thinking Oda knew since day one that it'd get this far is pretty crazy
I think Oda is good at working new things into old things
Yeah
Exactly
The thought of a "second half" seems like oh shit this manga is going places
Once he hit thriller bark I think from there Oda was like shit this is going places
Or maybe after Alabasta
Oh yeah I'm not gonna dispute that at all
But that idea doesn't seem like something a manga artist just "trying to make it" would do and seems like something a manga that "needs to continue" would do
You don't over extend yourself because then you get a bad manga that looks bad in your portfolio for future projects
But once it's off its feet then you can go all out
Yeah One piece isn't really just a manga or anime to me
I've been consuming one piece since as far back as I can remember 💀
Yeah I mean it has more sentimental value to me m8
Go read Kingdom if you want a long series that you gotta use brain power for
I'm not scared about anything from Oda
I trust him lmao
Do I have things I want him to do? Yeah but I trust
I can't stand JoyBoy
He's voice literally makes me cringe idky
Like literally I can't even watch his videos at all
Not his voice but the way he says things
Idk he also made a video I really disagreed with but I don't remember it was years ago probably
Roger is cool but kinda too much for me
Tekking is great when he's not being crazy
Yeah I like his crazy don't get me wrong but when he starts talking about it I'm all in
Yeah for sure he's the only anime YouTuber I watch daily
Yes exactly
He's also a genuinely good person
Tekking really does have a good heart
I remember when everything involving BLM and George Flyod first happened he was genuinely brought to tears and made a really heart warming speach unlike any other YouTuber making a speach just to make one
It seemed like he does what he does not for others but because it's what he truly believes
I love companies like Rooster teeth but once you're that big of a company they act like they have to say something to set an image for their company and while that's   not bad in any way it seems so much more personal when it came from Tekkings heart and not a PR board
Omg I didn't even think of that
Eneru comes back and kills kaido
LMAO
Piccalo vibes
LMAO
8 mile
But like 8 watts
Cant everyone fly if they're strong enough?
Well ig it depends on your definition of "fly"
This channel is beautiful and genuinely brought a tear to my eye so happy to see everyone catching up and enjoying one piece
I mean if the user is strong enough yeah sure
Just kick the air
Yeah that too
||Also his is a weird fruit||
|| Oda does break set rules of the general df types and while some people might be against that I think it allows us to be surprised here and there by weird fruits like the mud fruit ||
Nah but if he tries running bb has 2 choices
Kill him or capture him
If it would be more of a hastle to give the fruit to a new inexperienced user
Then he'll capture him
I think it comes down to if bb see's moria's skill with the fruit as more of a benefit than just killing him and replacing him
Nah you guys misunderstood
They're saying there's one more SAGA after this one
Not arc
To be fair we're half way through this saga and it's been like 3-4 years already
So it kinda makes sense
But I agree yeah I thought 2 more sagas
Same
While I don't want a bad sequal like Boruto
I do at the same time
Yes or Roger
Or Coby
Yeah there's so many characters that have important histories
I think a lot of the shanks yonko arc is gonna be flash backs
While that would be cool idk how the end of the story would affect the world at large so idk about a Luffy kid adventure
Yeah it's the manga channel
Yeah that'd be cool with Luffy acting as the shanks
Kinda like Sinbad but backwards
That show is so much better than the original
I mean there's a difference between spoilers and just talking about a character that has been in the manga for a long time
I think the spoiler channel is for the spoilers for the next chapter no?
Nah as long as it's current or before we good
Yeah they said Makinos son which would be a spoiler to people not caught up
They mean spoilers as leaks and stuff
Yeah
Haki stuffs
My bad guys I was on a spiritual journey
On it found something
I know who's the best JOJO
Without a doubt it's Joseph Jostar
Stans are worse than hamon
I mean one piece 20 years old
21*
So you know about the.
Then*
Fair enough
Discord was made 23 years ago
<:ZoroWeary:701983967041159169>
That's insane
Bro how many years have we been in the yonko saga?
I mean yeah makes sense 50 ish a year times 4 = 200
Yeah makes sense why there's only 1 more data left
Saga*
If this one taking 10 fucking years and the next one even longer no worries boys
We still got double the life span
Ah this is insane
When do you guys count the Yonko saga starting?
I was thinking punk hazard
Punk hazard when they official made the alliance to take down Kaido
If the yonko saga started in punk hazard
That was 8 years ago
Almost an entire decade in one saga
And we haven't even finished dealing with 2 yonkos yet
Lmao
Nvm the yonko saga officially starts on Zou
So for half a decade
Which means if it takes the same amount of time to do shanks and bb as kaido and bigmom
That's a decade long saga
And we got 1 more
So 15 more years in one piece 👀👀👀
5 for the second half of this saga
And 10 for the last saga if it's the same length as this one
On God
<:EnelLUL:544293696397508618>
Yeah but it's Oda
He said Wano isnt starting for 3 years and it started the next year
7 years would be epic
I don't see why Shanks wouldn't be apart of the yonko saga
Maybe
Yes
<:ZoroWeary:701983967041159169>
<:Sanjimmhmmm:592245193101541376>
Yes
Nope
Copying me
No
! yup
Guys
Do u think Luffy will become pirate king? CIRCLE YES OR NO
Ussop op
He can shoot people
From afar
Crazy shif
Wci not my favorite arc by far
All arcs all good arcs except one lol
It's one-piece I don't hate anything
Yeah skypea wayyyyy better in the manga pacing is just insanely better
I'ma start watching wano because the animation so good
I've just been reading it
Yeah especially when the big war starts in like a year or some shit 💀
At least one piece isn't my hero
Straight up like 4 years ahead in the manga
I'd say over all the anime is better than the manga
Yeah it's seasonal
But also a weekly manga series
That makes no sense
It's not like they'll ever run out of content
Bnha viewer count especially for the last season was shit
If bnha was weekly instead of seasonal it'd by insanely more relevant
Idk one piece pretty fire now
Fire force
Maybe quality wise but when talking about viewers wise
It's literally tanked
You can look at viewer count and it's a parabola lmao
Idk I read it in an article after the end of the lesson
Season*
I'm sure you could find it online somewhere
Less people watch My hero than ever
One piece isn't loosing viewers
It's gaining
My hero isn't gaining
Yeah spoiler for bnha ig || the manga has gone to Shit and the only thing that could fix it is animation but that won't happen for like 4 years ||
He has black her still lmao he isn't that old
Probably all the stress from dealing with Zoro
Oda about to troll us and not talk about it all in any way
Idk 2nd and 3rd cousins kinda convoluted especially a shonen for like younger audiences
It might be a lil too complicated for kids to get probably easier to just say cousins and not dive that deep into it
Never is a strong word
You know those good ol post arc info dumps?
After wano i hope we have one for like 10 chapters lmao
When the war ends the strawhats don't just instantly disappear from wano
I think after the war we're gonna get heavy exposition
Why'd people hate it?
> <@564773067969265674> many thought the dancing was just to fill the 5 years gap <@426750321893703683>  I can see that but, that also shows how much of an iron clad will Oden had to do that for 5 years
If it was really just too waste time Oda could've retconed the timing
The 5 year thing plays into Odens character
> No one is the owner of shusui, it should be burried with Ryuma <@185141276847505410>  The previous owner gave it to Zoro which makes it his rightfully
No
It was Brooks shadow, Ryumas body
The way he spoke wasn't Brook at all
He was straight up a samurai
He had his memories
What makes you you?
If you have your memories but also some of another person's personality who are you?
Nah he smiled cause he's Yasui D.
Lmao
Yeah but like even if he didn't have one he would've smiled
Trust ik everything
Yes but it also depends on the wielder
It doesn't equal power
At some point a strong person has higher output than their blade can hold
So they need a better one
Yeah Zoro
Zoro straight up breaks any weak sword and that's before he even got that strong
Is the top rank of swords only for black blades?
> <@521783526878609418>  > No since White Beard has a top tier blade <@185141276847505410>  Yeah that's where I was going
I think maybe it is a black blade and Oda just didn't draw it
I think the Wado gonna break in a clash with Mihawk when he wins
> <@521783526878609418> which sword? <@426750321893703683>  White Beard's bisento
Why wouldn't he draw haki in the entire first half of the show
What other supreme grade blades have we seen?
Were they not black?
Ok so hear me out
Yoru is black and Zoro was told he could upgrade Enma to supreme grade if he made it a black blade
I think to become a supreme blade it'd make sense if it had to be black
Well ig we gotta wait for Oda to explain it
I think it's dumb that white beards blade isn't black
Ok so the theories I've heard are the either you need strong haki to do it or need lots if time
White beard had both
We don't know for sure
Because before it was black it wasn't the tank before supreme grade
I can't think of a single reason why white beards blade shouldn't be black
He's had his bisento for half a century
He died rather young tho
Yeah but we know a swordsman can Turn his blade black
So why wouldn't whitebeard the literal strongest man be able to
> <@521783526878609418> maybe this wasn't confirmed but for a sword to be black it needs to be constantly imbued with haki which happens when one trains a lot or fights a lot which WB didn't do because he just wanted a family and not to be a pirate king >  > And black balde means the color just changes to black, the blade is not permanently imbued with haki because we saw zoro cut monet with shusi and she didn't die. <@426750321893703683>  The family thing is a good explanation but it's not like White beard was a pacifist and fought other crews all the time
I think that's a good explanation tho
Not always
Back in the day he didn't his crew was much smaller
He had his bisento since at least when he met Oden
And by then he was already infamous
The family thing is pretty much the only reason I can think of
He had the power if thats what it takes and he had the time if thats what it takes
Y'all know why there's aura now?
Because the new animater from dragon ball
As simple as that
No it doesn't
It's literally beautiful
Different = bad to you
Do you think the broly movie is bad?
Ugly doesn't = different bro stop being so close minded
How
Hey you know what's crazy?
Just don't watch the anime
What an animater who specializes in making things extravagant made the already existent aura even cooler? Woow
That's why he was hired bro
The Broly movie literally destroyed the box office in sales
We should be happy to have the animater from the movie
Not crying because it's different
He was put as the one piece head animator for a reason if u don't like it then don't watch homes
Except that's what they wanted
"we"
Don't speak for anyone but yourself
I mean it's literally the decision of the studio
He's acting like this man came up and shit on Odas work
Lol yeah that's what I'm doing
W
Thank u Doom
People from reddit don't like something?!?
CALL THE PRESSES
Reddit doesn't like something!
Lmao
Enjoy it or don't this decision was made to make the manga better
People were mad about the post time skip animation Change
People always mad about something changing
No it's not
It's an anime the art style is the animation, unless you meant the way the characters move as animation
Yeah if you're talking about the movement then it's better then ever
But he means the art style and that's what I was referring too as well
Don't watch it
Animators are artist
They don't make the art for people who don't like it
> Coc can change weather too <@376748967137902594>  Nah bro that's too much I hate it why would the animators do that
LMAO
Adam wood strong against shit like crashing it can't take a straight up yonko hit 💀
Hiyori crying somewhere
Jesus Christ Tanu
<:ZoroNut:632474447462400010>
Kaido fucks big mom in a double spread page
As a kid
I never stopped
Searching for a great treasure
One piece outro 1 is a masterpiece
I had a map in my mind That I knew would lead me I had to find my way to that place Before someone could beat me The promised land was in my grasp And I wouldn't let go
> Luffy Kidd and law fighting in the new op is sooo good <@564773067969265674>  It's good but have you heard ending 1?
I'm rewatching it on Netflix
And fuck ending 1 is amazing
Yeah loser
Loser race
I'm so disappointed that Marco with perosparo and not King
But also he isn't fighting Perosparo
What are they doing
Bruh are you caught up?
Oh lmao
I mean theyret with each other rn
Yeah that might be it but idk why pero would betray bigmom
Pero is literally bigmoms right hand
I highly doubt that he's going to betray her
He's not katakuri
Bro did you just say jutsu?
<#206841928019476491>  come on bro
😔😔😔😔
<#206841928019476491> don't let me catch you all here again
No
I think Elbaf will be a lil shorter than dressrosa
NARUTO?!?
<#206841928019476491>
Delete that message now 😈
Lmao
I think Elbaf will be fishman island arc
Length
Picoloco? <#206841928019476491>  stop bro
The way shanks is connected to Elbaf <:ZoroNut:632474447462400010>
Thanks actually the second prince of Elbaf bro can't you tell he's a giant
All his size went to cock tho
Nah > That's a reach bro <@698761447835959337>  Eric the red most famous Viking, Shank... The red?!?
I mean when you have a viking ship and have red as your main characteristic there is obviously some Viking shit going on
I'm not sure if Shanks is connected to it
But I mean there's a good amount of evidence to loosely connect to it
Do you mean Laughtale?
Lmao
Nah I was joking I call it Raftel
I won't stop calling it Raftale or Raftel
Every
Bro why don't they just skip the Wano war arc we already did the build up that's enough right?
> <@!536282939038892053> you mean the flashback <@319602380041879552>  Nah bro time travel
Luffy actually causes the Void century by traveling to the past
Damn one piece version of Boruto be like Void century again
Wait wtf
<#206841928019476491>
Come on bro
Bro Kaido just going to New kamaland in impel down leave him alone
Homie just wants to party
Lmao tbh the manga isn't canon because Oda's hands drew it not his mind
> One piece is one piece <@241848072328445952>  Nah
Nah anything besides Odas mind isn't canon sorry bro
If you talking about anything besides what's in odas head that isn't one piece and I expect you to go to <#206841928019476491>  RN 👿
Kaido been captured multiple times
Yeah if Orochi was still living I think he would've like, moved? Or, breathed?
If we could proof read it then we could read Japanese and wouldn't need Artur in the first place
Bro why don't people just read Japanese idiots
I listen to Tekking and Totally not mark
Yeah Tekking loves Artur
One piece has no villains bro
Just misunderstood heroes 😔
Who's tryna play a one piece dnd
Yeah Tekking does one peace dnd but the people he does it with are boring so I don't wtach it
Like literally no one has energy so it's just Tekking doing shit
Is that the guy with the accent? He's the only other entertaining one
> Knight <@258408841878831104>  Yeah he does the accent right?
I also only watched episode 1 when it came out
They mostly seemed like first time dnd players which isn't bad at all but it's hard to make a dnd show when you're learning to play and trying to be a personality
As they play I'm sure it gets funnier
But because I used to work so much I barely watched it
Nah Tekking has done a few campaigns and even started writing his own he's done a lot of research on it
It's hard to be new at something complicated like dnd and be a good personality at the same time I don't blame them at all
Nah when they started the one piece dnd he had already released a few dnd vids and talked about his own campaign
You could tell he was more focused on being funny than the game because he was used to it
I don't blame the people as DND ain't easy when first starting
Especially when you have to be a YouTube personality at the same time
LMAO
What happened
Is that what happens when you curse?
He said a bad word and insulted the mods
Rip
I'ma be honest tho people who are super uptight about which channel you send legit 2 messages in slightly off topic are so annoying
A quick tangent doesn't mean switching to a different channel bro
<:ZoroWeary:701983967041159169>
Idek who that was
Bro the poor editor we get it he overreacted let's not hang him for it
I didn't either
But like would you rather never have an editor say their opinion again for the sake of avoiding the community attacking them? Or a new editor overreacting a little bit one time?
Everyone attacking him is just gonna make it so legit no editor is gonna say their opinion ever again
Idk there's a difference between an opinion and spoiling
Chouchou a legend no cap
Damn not gonna lie
I do be missing katakuri rn
The dog
Chouchou literally has a better willl than Ussopp
Nah but I often think back to it when referring to certain racially fueled  current events of today
Yes
The savior
More than Ca- nvm
Lmao
Where the Chouchou emojis at wtf
Nah
King is in Uranus
Like what if Kings people specialize in Uranus
Not they're calways inside of and working on Urnaus
King must love Uranus
Yeah Kaido does have Uranus
He's strong enough to take Uranus when ever he wants
> wtf how did kaido get my anus <@703504844903940096>  Bro homie strong enough to take it
anyone who's not Odas brain isn't canon so idkkkk
Like the things Oda says aren't canon because it came from his mouth not brain
Damn imagine if Marcos flame could hurt people
Marco would be the most op man out here
Kinda like lion man
Golden boy Shiky
Wiki itself isn't canon
Not Odas brain
Until wiki can connect cybernetically to Oda brain nothing canon
Nah no canon movie yet
Best girl Yamato
Shiki sleaping bro
Idky they didn't put him on rocks crew
Yeah alright dummies
Yamato >>>>>
Shiki hibernating
He's trying to find his legs
W
All I do on Instagram is argue with dumb people
"Admirals are as strong as Yonko" Ok idiots time to debate
Discord
Imagine thinking an admiral could 1v1 a prime yonko 🤡
And win
Nah he's as high as one
Yeah prime garp
Kaido shits on current Garp
Pk level is weak bro wtf
How strong is a dead body?
Oh no here comes Rogers lifeless dead body boho hope he doesn't give me worms
Shanks is actually only 47 level seat 6 yonko commander Max
Y'all overestimated him bro
Luffy barely 8th supernova level
Ah yes Dragon the yonko
Shanks weak bro wdym
A sea serpent thing ate his arm
Garbage ass character
Literally anyone, I mean legit anyone! Remember that Marine that allowed Coby to join? Yeah even him. > shanks
Nah tbh me and Oda talked about this
SSG just making iPhones for the Marines
Snapchat time boys
Nah bro trust DF ain't shit when you for an iPhone
Kanjura still alive Oda doesn't off screen off a character we've had for literally about 7 years now
Nah I don't think he's dead, why would he be dumb enough to face all of the scabards by himself like that with no real back up?
He knows all of their power
That's still not backup
Kanjura isnt a normal character, his entire life has been about deceiving the scabards and learning everything about them, I highly doubt he would just decide to fight them head on without anything planned
He's been a major character for the past 7 years
Oda isn't gonna offscreen him
Shanks stops another war
Damn this is the first time since Marineford that mass deaths are gonna happen
Luffy said this was a war so ig it is
Nah
A lot of beast pirates and Samaria
I forgot the punk hazard gas
And who died in Dressrosa? people were just like knocked out and captured
Weren't people evacuated tho
Move away from it?
Huh how do you evacuate from anything bud?
Yeah but it was stopped
Yeah but it did stop the one time it was used in the story
Or kinda small
The tontadas could've gone through it
Punkhazard was a massacre
Does Buggy have haki?
Yeah that's death
But like war level mass death
The gas in punk hazard ricked da people
Blood
Blood is scarier
It's also based on a book that used blood
There was a sea of blood somewhere in there
Dragonman
No
> boiling blood is just boiling water <@703504844903940096>  Boiling blood would actually have less water than normal Blood
It would become thicker
> after 100 degrees the blood would just become vapour <@703504844903940096>  Yes but as you boil water you leave nothing, when you boil blood there's still the part of blood that isn't water left
Boiling blood is how some color pigment was made a long time ago
So the more you boil blood the thicker it will get
It's like boiling a stew
The more time you allow it to cook the less water it will have and the thicker it would get
Yeah because it's mostly water, the part of blood that boils is the water which turns into steam, the sodium iron and other parts in the blood don't turn into a gas at 100 degrees
Which would make the whole thing thicker the longer you boil it
It's the same idea as cooking something down
Yeah its just like stew
Sanji facts
I made a dumb joke about ssg calm down m8
I gotta go work out I'm out too
It's his will they're carrying on
If you think of ryou and Haki as just the will power of someone makes enough sense to me
If it's touched upon more than I could disagree with how it's dealt with but if it's just that 1 statement I think it's fair enough
Just drank 20 ounces of muscle water
Bruh moment
> since he has been captured BY mARINES BEFORE <@319602380041879552>  That would make sense but he was captured multiple times
So at least twice
But I'm assuming they would've just said twice
But also could've been when he was younger
Maybe the historians were just like flat earth conspiracy theorist and there's only 1 moon
Nah
How often we looking at the sky
> maybe that panel is representing old astrology believes when people thought everything revolves around earth <:BrookShrug:680559335058702376> <@690158729685106749>  I think this probably the best explanation I've ever heard tho that makes more sense than anything else
> notice the other body with a moon itself <@561641021268557825>  Moons with other smaller objects orbiting them not impossible
Maybe it was joke Stupid kid Robin's bad science project and they were all making fun of it
I mean I don't think there's multiple moons but,
There's more evidence to say there is than to say there isn't
No one has said "there's one moon"
We've also never saw a lot of things in one peace that doesn't mean it isn't real
Also there's planets with moons that each have different rotational cycles that are insanely different
I don't think there's multiple moons
But there's factually in one peace a diagram of what normally in science would be a planet and it's moons
0 no moons
I mean I'm not agreeing with anything I'm just saying until we know for sure we literally can't for sure say either way
> because that model is the classic geocentric model and usually refers to planets and not moons <@495255829369454612>  While I do like the idea of the histroians thinking in the geocentric mind space as an explanation of this it's a fact that the one piece world is way to technologically advanced to believe that
They literally blew up the model with giant guns from a giant warship
The eras and ideas wouldn't match up at all
Its technologically advanced enough for the literal most studied people in the world to know the earth isn't the center of the galaxy
I mean while yeah technology levels are different around the world that's because some islands have less contact with the outside world than others that's just factually incorrect for the scholar of Ohara who were famous around the world for being the smartest ever
All I'm saying is we cant 100% say either way
There's a model studied by the literal most advanced historians of the time that appears to support the multiple moon theory but then again we haven't seen the moons
> How do u know OP's planet isn't the center of the galaxy? <@415999229564157955>  Basic things like orbiting the sun probably are the same in the one piece world m8 if the earth was the center many things would be completely different
Ig but if you wanna say that none of our physics apply to one piece than literally everything we know of most of one piece would be different
The gravational force needed to literally everything would be different
The basics of what we know would be completely different
Yeah but if the force is the same then so should the things that affect the forces
Ig but my original point stands, we don't know for sure either way
There could couldn't be multiple moons
> Oda could literally say they've only had one moon because the other 5 orbit the other side of the planet at the time <@114296407816404992>  Yeah that's a fairly normal thing with some planets
Nah I disagree, unless we've shown specifically there's only one moon we can't stick with anything
We didn't see the grandline until they were there that doesn't mean it didn't exist
There's moons that take literall earth decades and centurys to orbit a planet
I feel like in a world with people who can kick the air to walk on it multiple moons isn't that crazy
> Not only have we only seen just one moon at the sky at any given time, it seems to be the same moon every time <@206896898215378945>  That's an odd claim?
How could we possibly tell the difference especially when the  art style has changed throughout time
There's a moon every 30 days
> Permanent daylight on Enies Lobby. Any opinions on that? <@251249266121506816>  LED lights under the water
Bluetooth probably too
Kizaru jerks off on enies loby daily
He says "let there be light"
There's multiple rn i think
Exactly
Lmao
Yeah makes sense
Again why would a people that are fairly technologically advanced believe that
If you tell me a tribe on some island thought that then sure
This is the Oharan scholars known across the world
People were Geocentric because of a lack of technology
That a group of people who have the technology of war ships and machine guns think they are geogentir?
In the real life pirate era people know the earth wasn't the center of the galaxy
In fact the geocentric era had completely ended more than a century prior
I don't think there's evidence to disprove the multiple moons but not enough to prove it either
Luffy saying this is a war is amazing
Yeah it's war time baby
Dressrosa is much better when you binge it than watch or read it weekly
Also direct correlation between Oden and Roger and Yamato and Luffy
Small lines Oda draws to compare Roger and Luffy
Fishman island a good solid arc
Idk no one but the red scabards have such an insanely strong reason and feeling toward kaido
Damn how could we all be so blind
The sheep guy who made the going Mary was a mink all along
> <@!521783526878609418> you mean Merry who designed Going Merry <:CarrotSmug:701664910865858580> <@319602380041879552>  Yeah
Momo gonna finish off Kaido no cap
Momo gonna turn into his adult form and go dragon and finish kaido
No
I think only the best minks are
The strongest I mean
Like I'm sure all the guardian ones can control sulong
Didn't work last time
Kaido still has the numerical advantage tho
A small time skip wouldn't be bad
After wano where the strawhats help fix things in wano a lil
Yes
Wait no
Nah I think the scaberds chilling
They finna help Momo rebuild after
Inu < neko       Dogs > Cats
W
Werewolf boy coming
Neko literally has an arm canon
He's so cool
Yeah on his leg not as cool
Neku way better but in real life dogs are better
Lmao
Inu isn't better
He literally Garbo
Even Carrot has more personality than Inu
Yes I always prefer sexual predators over cool loyal swordsmen
Lasagna indeed
Nah Neko the exception
Also nekos weapon cooler too
W
Got em
Stop
Loser
Bruh what
Merry sulong
Merry a mink
Y
LMAO
All minks can go sulong but only some can control it
Bepo solung makes him want to cuddle people
I can't see u
Bepo went let's go exploring
You can't say dick bro wtf 👿
Imwhag is bounce house?
<:LawWut:586269499494498334>
Ah awakening Luffy
Neko so cool
I love his weapon
Polearms just cool
Glaives from kingdom
Just finished lifting I can no longer move W
Breaks are always strategically at the worst times
I've already drinking a lil over a gallon today I'ma just sleep
I fasted today too aside from protein shake and bar
Damn that's tuff
I've been in 4 car accidents so anything involving my back is harder
I gotta do insanely more stretches than normal people
And I would love a role how do I get one?
Yeah
He used armorment against bigmom
Did I do it?
How do I know if I have a role?
W
For the sake of being a yonko commander I just hope Ace had basic Haki
Sbs I think
At least CoC was
COC is confirmed but as a yonko commander I like to head cannon that he has all 3
That's a good point but Smoker could've just pulled an Aoikiji and just move his body around the haki punch
Sabo the coolest
<:SaboEvil:705903442995970058>
Yeah ight
I think my only resentment with Sabo is his bounty
Bruh Mud man
Sabo didn't even come back he was just introduced lmao he wasn't mentioned at all till later
Oda didn't think of Sabo at first
At least I don't think he did
Nah I'm just saying Sabo wasn't mentioned at all in the first half of the show
> lol, people really expecting Oda to have planned EVERY single detail of the story since the beginning <@474659436804177930>  Lmao I don't but I was just saying Sabo is one of those things he didn't plan at first
Obviously no big manga was expected to go as long as they went
Oda is great to tieng in no things into old things
Nah I don't think so
Yeah Totally not mark still thinks they blood brothers
I genuinely can't remember watching everything for the first time so idek what I was thinking back then
Yeah that's the difference
Rubber has more resistance than mochi does
I think the only reason Kat wouldn't be able to do gear like things is like you said his body is made out of mochi its not it's properties so it doesn't like have resistance against itself if that makes sense
Damn my ex was named Kat now we sad mode
Oda went nah bro logia? Nah Special Paramecia
As Eminem once said "I got your name tattod on me twice now fuck now my new girl has to be named Kim"
Time out I'm watching Tekkings review
And why is Hawkins with Law wtf
It really does look like it
> hawkins is with law when? <@735836669445537863>  I'm not 100% sure it's him but someone standing next to law in the last chapter and from behind he looks exactly like Hawkins
Look at the law scene in the last chapter
We don't know for sure if it is but if it is dam that's a good ally to have
Thanks Margaret
Yeah there's a big chance it isn't
But if it is epic
Lmao
Berserk is good but read Kingdom
Berserk is a nother good fight manga but kingdom is something very different
Sorry if this isn't <#206841928019476491> just stating my kingdom opinion
Kingdom fills an itch of strategy and politics that I love that One piece whole amazing doesn't really have
Douglas Bullet who?
Damn I wonder when we'll get a new movie
> mfw I realize mark's probably read ace's death by now<:Crydo:586275183032270849> <@491390898031296532>  From a comment he made i think he was spoiled on it tbh
Ah that's cool the 1 year anniversary was literally a few days ago
Yeah I'm really worried someone spoiled the ace death for him but he literally said "I hope no one dies, or do they?!?!?" And a pic of ace appears
So idk tbh
Idk Bigmoms back story wasn't rocks related
Im just as hungry for rocks as everyone else tho
And it looks like Kaido was young while in rocks crew so probably more important in his life
<:ZoroWeary:701983967041159169>
Damn people really think Garp the current strongest marine still by a lot
Blew my mind tbh
Even if he is there's no way it's by a lot
I agree
<:AkainuSweat:586408945137090571>
Akainu when he sees garp
I have a headache from fasting so I'ma sleep it off GN boys
> <:LuffyAaaaahhhh:230860377745915905> <:aFeelsAceMan:586371608382537759> <:AkainuSweat:586408945137090571> <:WBDisgust:650047749831524372> <@212265078739828737>  LMAO
LMAO nah Im not like ill or anything
I just plan on intaking a lot of calories tomorrow so I'm lowering my calorie intake today
Just maths
😎
Yeah I used to do it a lot
I haven't fasted in like a year tho
Tomorrow is my rest day from working out so for the first time in like a month I'm gonna eat fast food breakfast
Deficit
Yeah gaining muscle mainly
Nah I'm not like on a high deficit
I'm still on a deficit but mostly just changing the calories I intake
I'm mostly on protein and Bock choy
Because bok choy is the god of vegetables
I also drink a gallon of water a day
Lmao I'm actually a chef so we out
Not to flex but I worked at the #1 restaurant in Miami before Covid
It's called La Mar by Gaston Acurio
I couldn't even afford to eat there 😔
High end we change the menus pretty frequently
A few fixed items but seasonal mostly
Eh you get used to it
My job has gotten me closer to my goals in life I got really lucky tbh
Through my job I got to meet, hang out with, cook for, and coook with the current and previous #1 chef in the world
Covid kinda fucked my industry so I gotta join the Navy for a few years to get the good good benefits
Lmao I get you I've literally been driving since October and I've been in 4 car accidents
Mostly cause I worked close to and sometimes over 50 hours a week while being a full-time highschool student while taking care of my grandpa
So like I was out of it during that time most of the time when I wasn't working
Covid revived me lmao
Yeah lol we all chill now tho I graduated and my grandpa got better
Japanese people are xenophobic
Sometimes lol
All people have goods and bass to them tbh
Japan straight up the most Xenophobic country probably
Also has a failing economy which is sad
The Olympics would've saved itb
It*
But then covid said nah
Literally in 2 decades if Japan doesn't change economy gone
You're 100% correct the economy is getting worse because the status of living is so high
As the status of living increases, the population triangle shifts, rn Japan's population triangle is literally upside down
They have wayyyyy more old people than they do kids
Their population can't support the economy, the Olympics was supposed to bring in foreign workers
Japan can't sustain itself in a few decades without the help of foreign labor but it's also really hard to go work in Japan because of the lasting effects of xenophobia
Japan's problem is bad and good at the same time
They wouldn't have the problem in the first place if the country wasn't as xenophobic in the first place
Just like if Wano was opened by Oden dad back then this probably wouldn't be happening in Wano
Nah I'm saying if it was
Nah the WG would be more involved
Well also I'm not Oda so idk
But in real life, if Japan wasn't as close minded and xenophobic in the past it wouldn't be upside-down triangle now
To die
He wants death
Yeah
Oohh the Yamato thing cool
Where's Coby I love him so much
I miss him
Coby best marine
Coby then smoker
Yes
But he still thinks the good out weighs all the bad
Maybe he's right
Targeted CoC 100% a thing
I'm back boys
And legit Luffy using it at Marineford, he targeted it mostly at the executioners and not just everyone around him
> Luffy couldn’t target it at marineford <@372464153480134666>  Nah he saw Ace about to die so not even only him tho lmao Whitebeard tried using conquers Haki on the executioners but failed because of his sickness, then Luffy uses it knocking out the executioners but not just a bunch of Marines in the huge circle
Yeah for sure but if he could control it he would've just knocked out the Executioners
I mean that's why he used it in the first place tho
The executioners were about to kill Ace
What?
Oh yeah he didn't use it on purpose
Whitebeard also tried using his COC to stop them but failed
White beard was really far away
With a bullet to the head
No prisoners
Yes 😈
> sea prism wont work on them <@460418344584085514>  Lmao well I mean sea prism may not weaksn normal people but it's still super durable and unbreakable so if the person is super strong you'd still probably use it
Yeah
Yeah even for a non df user it's still literally impossible to escape
No
But does seastone completely cancel out a devil fruit?
Like is Luffy no longer rubbery when tuchjnf seastone?
Seastone just weakens them it doesn't turn of their df right?
So if ace is in contact with it in just his hands his entire body is enable to use his fruit at all?
Yeah it does
Nah you can still use your fruit in water
Yeah but I think Luffy could still stretch in seaprism cuffs
Damn I brought this up because it would be cool for law to be able to create a room and cut seaprism in it just like how he cuts people in half and shit
Alright let's settle how Buggy's fruit works
I think the only reason Mihawk didn't cut him wasn't because Buggy is immune to Haki it's because Buggy was splitting his body right before the cuts touched him
Buggy being immune to haki literally breaks the rules that are set into place in the story
I mean he was straight up on the pirate kings crew he isn't just a normal pirate
> Mihawk *couldn't* cut him. It's not that he didn't. He is immune to cuts. <@171861037438599169>  If he used Haki I think he could've
> He is immune to cuts. <@171861037438599169>  Luffy is immune to punches and bullets, until haki is involved
Dam it's over now
Doom going angry mode
I mean tbh I don't remember every detail of every arc ESPECIALLY Dressrosa lmao
Any fruit that you can't use on your own is literally worse fruit
Why didn't he just have a pet dog
But like
A big one
> the good old "if it's not able to use it in 1on1 honorable combat, it's bad" fruit <@160778857702490113>  Nah not what I mean, but if he doesn't have his brother around what is he gonna do?
My point was if you have to rely on someone else for your fruit to work it's a bad fruit
How easy is it for him to forcefully make someone wear him?
What?
> so belo betty's fruit is bad? <@171861037438599169>  This was a terrible example and bad analogy
Yes but the difference is she isn't using her fruit to fight herself
The jacket guy is
Doom mad because people don't like jacket man grree
Why people no like jacket man?!?
I read manga jacket man good!!!!
Alright my bad let me rephrase
If your fruit is about YOU fighting, then it's dumb for it to have to rely on others to work.
Because Belo Betty isn't a fighter
Jacket man is a fighter
> I re read that chapter and if bobby didnt want to wear kelly theres no way kelly could have forced it <@703504844903940096>  Imagine a jacket trying to make u wear it?
What are u gonna do?!? 😢😢😢😢
Not wear it? No impossible
Guys I can see.... a jacket in my closet!! Someone come help!!!!
And then fighting
Bro it's literally about you fighting
Homie wearing boxing gloves at all times
You right he a politician
Very head cannon of you to assume he has other moves
Choc I'ma be honest man it's a shit fruit, how forceful could you be to force a jacket onto someone?
🚓🚓🚓🚓🚓
Sorry Choc had to do it you FBI read that message on their way to your house
There's so many things to debate in the one piece world
And we talking about if a jacket can forcefully make someone wear it
LMAO
Be had to put his sleeves on himself
He tries to control a wolf
But instead just dies
W
A wolf wouldn't let a jacket be forced on u
Source: Logic
Choc let me try forcing a jacket on u
Y'all remember that one episode of Jimmy neutron where all the pants attacked the city?
> <@!521783526878609418> **you think he'll use the same tactic for a wolf that he uses when working as a team with his brother?** <@160778857702490113>  It doesn't matter what tactic hell use on a wild HE'S A FUCKING JACKET
Moving = forcing a jacket onto a wolf?
> a jacket that can force other things to wear it , how is this so hard to understand when its litteraly mentioned in the manga <@198930928083402753>  Let me read where it says "force" in the manga
Head cannon boys
Moving doesn't equal forcing a wild animal to wear you
Bro actually wait I can move! Can I forcefully wrap myself around a full grown wolf by myself?
> it's headcanon to assume that he just has to lie down and wait for something to wear him <@160778857702490113>  No it's fact that from what we've seen someone puts him on
Yeah you right my bad
But not because any moving creature can
I'm just built different
But then he'd be controlling a beat up wolf 🥺

I want you all to go get a jacket rn and attempt to force a human on the streets to wear it
Until then we won't assume he can just force himself onto anything
Yeah but you're sentient aren't you?
Try forcing a peace of clothing on any human
Especially one stronger than you
Lmao
Good luck bro
Ah yes the science of forcing clothing on others
> scientfically speaking you can do it <@198930928083402753>  My favorite science
Moving = Forcefully making yourself worn by someone else
Great
Doom when someone doesn't agree with him: You just think what everyone else thinks grrrrrr I'm different
Gaben go rn with a jacket to someone STRONGER than you and force someone to put it on
Please record it
Then I'll be proven wrong
When you guys can prove that a sentient jacket can make another person wear it with facts I'll say your right
Until then 🤷‍♂️
Then die bro
No one forcing you to read this tbh
It's as simple as closing discord or leaving this foruo
Why because I'm not gonna believe something because you just say so?
Guys jacket can force humans to wear it! How? Yes
Gaben send the manga
Because you're brain dead bro
Literally never said anything about forcing others
Gaben making new manga pages up guys Gaben is Oda omg
Gaben please if you're just gonna repeat it's there it's there I swear without it being there then don't talk because at least Doom has an actual argument
Enrobe doesn't mean the word force
Guys I think I know everything so I take the manga and say it means X because ik stuff
Imagine arguing over something that you interpreted as true
Doom are u serious? Have you read anything people have been saying to me? Legit Gabet just says brain dead brain dead over and over to prove his point
I mean idc but like at least read
Lmao
Yeah after saying they want to die because they read my messages
I don't insult people unprovocated bud
At the end of the this is a manga legit just a leave of entertainment and art people insulting each other over OUR interpretation of it is genuinely dumb
Oh shit my bad
This is like American politics
But instead of jacket df they talk about the constitution lmao
On God doom I was enjoying myself arguing with u but when people literally just start going Alex you're so fucking dumb and stupid hahaha it's pretty annoying
And idrc but it turns the argument into something much more sour
Neko gonna go sicko mode
Lmao
Piccolo actually rules up and says nah and blows up the moon
Because he's the GOAT
Yes
<:ZoroNut:632474447462400010>

Alice in wonderland type vibes
Neko gonna eat some ass
Kaido ass
> some are expecting diffrent sulongs to have diffrent elements tho idk bout it <@198930928083402753>  Like besides electric?
I mean just because he does have Alice in wonderland vibes the cat from that do have teleportation powers
Maybe he'll be moving so fast that it's gonna look like teleportation
White when the bigmom lion went sulomg did he turn white?
Yeah pekoms my bad
I'm bad with names
All white makes sense because if the snow
Yo wait time out
I never watched all of wci just read it, did Pekoms go crazy mode and do cool shit all around the town in the manga? Cause in the anime homie going crazy
Legit I only remember him being held down and shit in the manga
Am I having memory loss
In the anime pekoms legit a super hero
It's queen
Abandoned? LMAO FAT L BRO
That'd be sick
I hope Neko joins while Inu take care of all of Zou
Do you guys consider every strong character who uses a sword a swordsmen?
> Shanks is stronger, Mihawk <@283276421470748673>  You read my mind lol
I think it comes down to shanks not considering himself a "swordsman"
Yeah
Oh lmao
Nah no way bro
Shanks weakest yonko Luffy strongest 5th yonko
> <@!460418344584085514> shanks stronger than mihawk sorry* <@651757948061745162>  Oh yeah I think so tbh
Idk if Mihawk has CoC
> imo you call someone a swordsman as long ass > 1. calls himself a swordsman with pride > 2. mainly uses a sword <@445046828824789002>  Yeah I agree shanks isn't a "swordsman" even tho he uses a sword
Also the home boy Gol D Roger used a sword
But he isn't a "swordsman"
> why isn't he a swordsman <@445046828824789002>  It comes down to the person's mind set at the end of the day I think
Ooo that's a way better question tho
Not who's stronger but who has more sword skill
Mohawk in sword skill tbh
<:ShanksHmmm:586437070742880257>
True
I don't think shanks would ever "scars on the back are a swordsmens shame"
Idk I don't really hate anyone in one piece tbh
I hate sabos bounty and that's about it
I think Flampee should be hated tho so I think that's a lil different
Oda wanted us to not like Flampee
> <@521783526878609418> why? <@606196171307745308>  Drgaon is the most wanted but his second in command has a very small bounty
I'm there's reasons to excuse this
But it'd just make more sense if it was higher in the first place
Like I get why it might be so low
But like 2nd in command of the literal enemy of the WG
Yeah after the reverie if he isn't captured or something it'll increase
Sengoku an under rated character
I mean he's done a lot, but you can always just say he did it without getting caught
And that's fine I don't mind that reasoning it's still probably one of the only things in one piece that bugs me a lil
Also waiting for the day when Shanks says he didn't have to lose his arm 😔
> We still might get a reasoning from Oda, it only got confirmed in an SBS <@283276421470748673>  Yeah for sure
Luffy goes "but shanks, you were strong enough back then to defeat him with just your conquers haki" Shanks replys "But Oda didn't know that in chapter 1"
I read redtaro as retardo lmao
Shanks is a showmen
He put on a good show then when he got on the ship him and the boys laugh "did you see luffys face when I lost my arm?!? LMAO"
What an idiot that kid
We decided it was best to move on
<:ZoroWeary:701983967041159169>
Jacket ban
Lmao
I wonder if his prev captain actually made it hmmmm
Yeah BB pain thing is kinda wear
Even if BB doesn't have multiple personalities he genuinely has some form of mental illness probably
The never sleeping thing kinda weird
LMAO
But he didn't even steal the bread they got the wrong guy
Bruh your cousin could destroy the world
That's where rocks is
LMAO
Like a theory almost
My headcanon fires COLA
Bro I just realized yesterday how much stuff At&t owns like wtf
They own all of Warner Bros, all of HBO, a big part of YouTube channels as they own a company that does nothing but does like partnership type things with channels, and much more
Warner Bros alone is huge
They own so much shit themselves
At&t way bigger than I thought
My bad just a At&t tangent
<:ShanksHmmm:586437070742880257>
Shanks a deby downer tbh
Why'd he stop the war?
Pussy
<:CobyCry:700488898610069565>
What a lil baby thing to do
> perospero was sitting on a candy slug in the middle of the ocean, he'd have no chance against marco who has instant regeneration and flight.  >  > It was probably Marco who prompted the temporary alliance <@348594551797317642>  Yeah I agree
If only the golden boy katakuri was there
Alliance is a strong word
More like diverge reinforcements
Perespero did not want an alliance so Marco tells him no reason for bigmom pirates to die here too bigmom will survive just don't send in any troops
The yonko saga would be very different
And BB would've escaped
During the Kaido crazyness
And I boil pasta doesn't mean I'm not scared of pasta
That's doesn't make much sense
But you know 🤷‍♂️
Wtf
Wievil would be a great Goalie
Same with Jouzu
Yup
Jozou for Goalie I mean
Damn tbh that'd be really cool to see
Like the ramen commercials they did
What if they did the one piece world for Olympic commercials
That'd be sooo cool
Mihawk and Zoro fencing
Sanji running
Luffy doing something lmao
Olympic one piece would be great
Well I mean shooting is also an Olympic sport lmao
Like literally ski shooting with a rifle also a sport
Swimming
Reyleigh going ham
Sanji behind him
Well it should've been this year lmao
Not to get back into how the lack of the Olympics will ruin Japan's economy again
But yeah they want it to be next year
But some people think it's not
Luffy was one too actually
It was all the major characters
Luffy Goku and Naruto were the main 3 but Sailor moon and a few others are ambassadors too
Yeah Luffy on the Olympic cover with them all
Yeah in American news report they only said Goku 💀 but if you look at the thing a bunch of famous animes are ambassadors
Yeah in all of the Olympics promotion it has everyone on it
This is official


Yokai watch I think
Astro boy
Sailor moon
Can't remember the lil kid
And idk the last two girls
But yeah Goku isn't really the main one but American reporters pretty much only known him and maybe Naruto so they said Goku in their articles
Brook a ref lol
Yeah you right
LMAO
Poor Coby
Wait
So like it's cannon that Sanji is strong enough to kick something around the entire radius of the earh
Which means Zoro is at least that strength
So Zoro can just cut the earth in half
Naruto fans SHAKING RN
One piece has planet busters easy
Uh if you're gonna watch the movie watch the filler too
The movie is good as hell tho tbh
I like all the post time skip movies wayyy more than the pre time skip ones
It's like more mystical I guess
Not all of them there's one filler that is important
G 8
No only G8
Everything besides G8 isn't important
Lmao yeah
Ah my child
G8? A legend
Beyond time and space itself
Even 7 generations from now G8 will still be whispered about
You past it already
It was way before the time skip
Thank u Tanu I didn't feel like googling it lmao
U a legend
I can't think of any good filler besides in DBZ
Driving episode
Baseball episode
DBZ filler are just slice of life animes with Gods
Fake? Nah bro piccolo just hate the dragon fruit and been hiding the whole time
Yeah it's fake
But I mean the enel if funny
I mean it's fake so it's more of a meme than a spoiler
I wouldn't say important to the story as much as just important to one piece and anime history
Making a filler arc that actually fits in with a series is really hard that's why people don't like filler
But G8 did it
It managed to break the norm set by animation at large
Yeah it does play into the story with the merry bit but still it's an amazing arc and tbh better than most one piece movies and some arcs
I mean literally wat better than the Davy back arc
Yeah like its normal for fillers to be bad like that's just to be expected when you take a story and just randomly add stuff to it
But then G8 actually does something amazing
I think the manga is better in pretty much every way except G8 and maybe the animation now in Wano
I also don't watch the wano anime I'm gonna watch it soon but there's really no reason to rush lol
It's the glasses
And the smoke
And the smile
Yeah blond vs white
Smoker is relatively young to the point he's a good rival to Luffy
But he just seemed older since logtown
Especially because Luffy couldn't even touch him
We need more antogonist that aren't just fighters but use strategy to defeat the strawhats like in G8
I thought that would be Orochi but he's just a poopoo head
Nah they manage to escape but the captain of G8 was like one of the few good Navy guys but he wasn't a fighter he was a thinker
He like played chess and used strategy against the Strawhats

Saw this on Instagram is epic
Dodging in place was an insane advantage becauss even if they have Haki it doesn't matter
I mean I think a factor you're ignoring here is techniques if Luffy just spammed gum gum pistol even if he had the same haki and speed as Kat he'd lose
> I think it’s safe to say that it’s about the full package not just individual things <@564773067969265674>  Yeah for sure if not then Luffy would be dead lmao
Pirates were also pretty democratic in real life voting in their captains and shared much more treasure between the crew than legal privateers did
Yeah
Mip at one point in history 50% of the population of the Western world were pirates
Lmao
The jacket does not divide this chat
I mean it's not your fault it's stereotypea
But realistically Pirates were people who were poor
Yeah they were just people who were poor and couldn't survive under legal means like being a privateer so they just joined pirate crews
I mean Im sure some were bad don't get me wrong they did break the law
But factually if you were a normal crew member of a pirate crew your captain would get maybe 2-3× more than you but if you were on a privateer ship the captain would take usually 10-14× more than you
Legal Privateer captains were literally rich and become Lord's and lands owners because of their privateering
I mean it was just legally how it worked back then
So many turned to pirates as it was more fair
Think illegal unions vs legal super oppressive capitalistic business owners
Throughout most of history it's rigged to be easier for the rich and people on top
Not all pirates were good and all of them were criminals
But they were criminals that believed in some basic equality between people
They committed crimes because if they didn't they would've died
Wait really?
I've never even heard of cover art theories this sounds so dumb
Franky if he was a shiny Pokemon
Wait what's the ace death one that sounds interesting
I'd say ace dying is probably one of the if not the biggest event in one piece so far
LMAO bruh
Tbh that just seems a lil too far of a stretch to me
Yeah I just meant for the manga itself
The stress of trying to save ace was real
Yeah his art style changed after the time skip
Ig
I don't like White beard
I love him 😔

Wdym Luffy a genius evidence that gif
Yeah he started getting the captain mentality back in water 7
Mythical zoans can translate to base at least in some form
Idk everyone want a piece of Orochi
A Momo kill would be good
Momo going into a crazed state and killing orochi over and over
Tbh disregarding my feelings for both Orochi and Kanjuro as characters, I genuinely think Oda isn't the type of writer to kill a character we've known and been with for literally 7ish years
Off screen*
Kanjuro has too much behind him to just die off screen in my opinion
Raizo deserves to die tbh
Life for life
All the minks death
Yeah probably
There's two of em so I think one will die
Ninja? <#206841928019476491>  grrrrr
> drifting a bit. Can BM give life to Moriah's zombies or can Moriah steal BM's homiws' shadows <@394081111686381568>  No
She can't put souls in human bodies
Idk that's devil fruit level stuff
> Well what if you need some people to operate something? <@131218004540129280>  Threaten them
If your COC is strong enough to mind control people you're probably known enough that the same random weakling would be scared ASF of u and do what u say anyways
On God lmao
Damn a fishman logis user kinda epic
Imagine if Jack was good
LMAO
Nah jack cool tbh
He's under rated
Imagine Jembei with a mythical zoan literally a god
Exactly
Yeah because he can still control water
Df or not he could still use most of fish man karate
Smoke?
Get high?
Yeah Marcos fruit my favorite it's basically all 3 types in 1
Literally all 3 types in 1 fruit I think Marco would be like way stronger if he didn't limit himself to just a commander
I'm not sure what exactly I meant either but let me try to explain
Nah
Lmao never said he's weak
I think if he was a captain he'd have more responsibility and have to strive to be better and stuff if that makes sense
That's true enough
Idk i feel like if Marco did what most of the other people did that we saw in the oden flash back and left and made his own crew under the WB alliance I think he'd be stronger
Not automatically but I think without someone like white beard with him 24/7 he would have to go through more stuff that would eventually lead to him being a stronger person
Not only responsibilities but literally having to go on an adventure on his own
Like imagine if Luffy instead of making his own crew just joined someone else's
> Like imagine if Luffy instead of making his own crew just joined someone else's <@521783526878609418>  I genuinely don't think he'd be who he is today
Ik and Marco is literally my top 5 favorite characters
He'd always try to take over like ussop in the beginning
What if Luffy and akainu died protecting Ace from white beard
> I would like to see Ace as the main character ngl <@634490470768050204>  Lmao it happened already
He has his novels
Marco > Every other yonko crew member besides Katakuri
Ace is just fire Luffy
Everything Ace did Luffy would do if he was just a tad bit more mature and was able to fallow someone else
And his respect for WB
Ace was a device but I also think he was a lovable character
Pasta.... Did you just fix anime?
Yeah the wano thing cool
<:aFeelsAceMan:586371608382537759>
Imagine if that fight happened with today's animation and art style? <:AkainuSweat:586408945137090571>
> What did ace achieve ? As a character <@564773067969265674>  He was known enough to be a warlord
Warlord status is a good indication tbh
> <@521783526878609418>  yeah but I mean what did he do within the time we see him ? <@564773067969265674>  I haven't read the novels so I really don't know but there's probably good stuff in there
I just know he did enough for a warlord status and to become a commander in WB crew
Wow not stupid
Sabo = Ace
Maybe Sabo a lil better
Oda actually wrote Ace and thought, " I'm gonna make him with 0 character and no substance other than Luffy lmao then I'll KILL HIM OFF LMAO"
As long as no one shits on Marco or Zoro idc tbh
<@564773067969265674> I want you to know the way you feel about Ace is the way I feel about Carrot
Not starting a Carrot argument here I'm just saying the things you're saying about Ace are the same things I feel about Carrot
Ace hate is so weird it's like people skipped Alabasta and Impel down and Marineford and 3D2Y
Everyone can have their opinion lmao
I'm just saying the way u feel about Ave is how I feel about Carrot
I like her just don't think she has substance and character but also I don't wanna argue this again because we did this yesterday lmao
LMAO
Substance= The amount of unique emotional value and characteristics that make that character not only invaluable to us as the reader but makes them an integral part in the one piece story or at least a part of it
Katakuri literally best antagonist
At least for me
I love Bigmom too she has great layered personality
She isn't just big strong villain
She's also someone who values people of all different races
But is also an asshole
But also has an actual disorder
But also lost her memory and became a lovable character
Big mom has more character and would be a better strawhat than Carrot <:ZoroWeary:701983967041159169>
Lmao
What bigmom is not an edgy swordsmen or dragon? Bad character grrr
Yeah some people in the community thrive on what's "cool" and hate everything that isn't as edgy as them
Katakuri is just overall awesome and a great juxtaposition to luffys character
Ace and Brulee
juxtaposition between Kat and Luffy is why Oda even went as far as to retcon the type of devil fruit he uses
Yeah like I said bigmom a great character
> I’m convinced half the fandom can’t take a character seriously if they’re not clad in bdsm gear or have 12-16 sets of Abs <@521427565492305931>  LMAO
Jimbei just pushed her
Is it that strange that one of the strongest Warlords pushed a hunger pain big mom?
If you hit someone and all it did was make them go in the other direction that's a push
I mean like she wasn't hurt she didn't complain
Oh lmao nah
Legit just pushed her back that doesn't make her weak
People thinking Jembei fudder so they think Big mom fudder cause he just pushed her back
Jembie third strongest warlord in the beginning
Nah
I think Doofy second strongest probably
Mihawk strongest
I forgot Kuma but may I think he's probably either = or weaker than Jembei
> Boa is stronger than Jimbei tbh <@708065448637497406>  Depends on the opponent
Nah I don't think so maybe jembei has a like 10/100 chance
> what the hell is warlord 4 level <@521427565492305931>  LMAO I fucking hate when people do this
Yeah Luffy actually only 6th yonko commander advizer 8 warlord level Max tbh
Kizaru if he was a warlord
Literally Jembeis only wins against Doofy if he has the ocean
If they by the water then jembei has a way better chance
> Jinbei with at least a cigar is def commander advisor level <@131218004540129280>  Fo sure unless he gets 2 cigars then maybe mid 5th commander advisor level
LMAO
Post time skip Morgan's level tbh
Pre time skip Morgan's ain't shit
Lmao

If only Sanji wasn't such a sexual predator and was more of his calm cool chef side he'd be one of the best characters
Damn 😔
Guess I'll kms now
Sanji good except for an over used dumb troupe
Tbh I could beat Zoro in a 1 v 1
But I'm just built different 😴
Yeah we just built different
> <@153273023456083969>  :0 do itttt <@477218487903977483>  Nah he don't have to Kin about to 1 v 1 him
Yo ik this ain't the right channel but this where's the most amount of people, so if anyone wants to do a one piece DnD I'd be down tbh
One piece dnd would be sick do anyone down dm me and we can make a chat
Raizo is high warlord level tbh he is a ninja
> One Piece dnd would be cool <@670057078064152577>  I'ma send it in the general chat too to see if anyone else wanna do it
Hey everyone
If anyone interested in doing a one piece dnd lmk
Yeah this is the anime chat
There's a manga chat and a catching up chat
Oh yeah why I came here from the manga channel
If anyone interested in doing a one piece dnd hmu
I'm trying to find a DM too so I don't have to do it but I'll dm if I have to
Ik there's a one piece dnd series on YouTube with tekking so I'ma watch that for ideas
I'll also ask the DnD discord if anyone there with experience wants to join and DM
The more the merrier
What we getting on?
I'll join in
Same
I'll bet that carrot won't join the crew and if she does all of you could decide my new name
Idc either way lmao
How about 6 months
Fleebles you betting against me?
Lmao for what?
Damn
I've already lost
Why?
Damn a punishment for losing a bet is just not talking in this chat for 3 days?
Bro that's a w
Exactly lmao
Even better
Damn if only
What's the bet tho
Yamato joining is a good one tbh but it could be a while before we know
Damn Vivi a baddy
That's cool
<:LuffyPeepo:632458634638524435>
Yeah I think there's a reason Marco isn't fighting him
Can someone send the panel with them together on the beach
Marco and pero
What
Oh
What they doing wtf
Why's it say bam
Nah they far away
Of course I can barely see them
Jack make no sense tbh
How is that his normal fishman form
Jack wyd bro
U ain't even a fishy fishman
You forgot me
Fuck I  had a pic of me after working out my shoulders and my neck looked huge
I looked like that one meme of the guy with the tiny head
Lmao
Sanji 😔
Literally has legs in his name
> I have to wait a week and 3 days for next chapter <@306372168827273216>  Damn u do why? That sucks bro
Makes sense
Yeah Marco was 15 or something
😔
Me
My neck huge
Bb also a kid
> all wb commanders are of equal status there is no first mate <@703504844903940096>  Nah Marco
Marco the golden boy
Wtf
Zoro
||This is the manga why we have spoiler bars 😔 ||
Yeah I'm oda
I said that
Trust
Nvm Pasta is oden now
Go ahead Pasta
How are they made
I liked your joke Kamui
My bad Kamui I meant <@698761447835959337>
Time out did Oda just draw Jembei as a fish?
We just gonna ignore that
Jinbei my bad guys
Cases
That's what y'all catching
LMAO
Ik right
No that he's a fish
Oohh t
I never read the sbs myself I just watch videos on it
So in the one piece DnD they just take away everything that isn't in one piece instead of adding things besides devil fruits
If anyone wants to play hmu I'ma start planning the campaign soon
White beard wtf
White beard long white hair
Whi D beard
Lmao
Ight I need like 5 more people for a one piece DnD campaign
Lmao
It's just like the moon exploding
God dam
I think big mom herself is more terrifying but as a whole I think the beast pirates are worse just because of the terrible shit they're doing to the people of Wano
Hey guys I don't remember for sure so clarify for me why Zoro personality is better than Sanji?
LMAO
I like Jinbei better than both of them tbh
I generally prefer Zoro more as Sanji can be creepy and just unfunny to me
Again that's just my opinion
But when I find something creepy even if Zoro is just cool I prefer him
Yeah if Oda liked Sanji more WCI would've been Sanji doing cool shit
WCI is just "bro Sanji blocked Katakuri jelly beans so he's yonko commander level easy"
"Sanji destroyed Oven so he can beat Yonko commanders no problem"
> <@!521783526878609418> sanji's goal isn't focused on fighting though, he wants to find the all blue. Plus WCI emphasised his cooking skills more than his fighting because thats a central part of his character <@375397668727291911>  I agree 100% but I'm just saying what Sanji cock riders have told me
You can enjoy samji and not think he's super strong
I love sanjis character besides the over sexualization doesn't mean I think he's super op
Tbh Sanjis 3D2Y shit was kinda weird, liked all he did was run and learn new recipes so he learned haki and skywalk?
Sanji learned all those cool boosting recipes and haven't shown them at all
As I'm a chef I was excited to see how Sanji uses the special hormonal vitamin body enhancing cooking he learned and it hasn't been mentioned at all
Nothing happened would be better if Zorotards didn't ruin it so much
I think it's better than any scene Sanji has had tho
I'd chose Luffy Sanji Zoro tbh
Or maybe Sanji Zofot Jinbei
Lmao yeah that's why I changed it for jinbei lmao
LMAO wtf
Zoro be like
Nothing happened
Ussop would still be lying and that girl would be dead
Besides movies yeah
And maybe raid clothes will be amazing if they have the same clothes as in the opening
Sanji has straight up a movie style red suit thing in the intro
Scars do disappear over time
Nah I mean 2 year time slip
And the one piece world is different
Teeth grow back with milk
!speedreadee
Fuck
Readee
LMAO
Rip this chat
!headcanon
Toki? I only remember relevant characters
Any characters from more than 20 chapters ago that don't play any roll don't live in my brain no more
Zolo 3 is great
Damn it'd be cool to have all the box sets but they kinda 100 each
I have the money for it but like idk bruh it's kinda free
Lmao
Apoo yonko level
Simple
Yeah
Fuck
!apoo
Damn it'd be so cool if everyone started a one piece dnd with me 😴
Robin?
More like boring
Zoro x Robin? More like Edgy + Slightly attractive = soooo cool
I mean I'm not but ok
I literally do nothing but make fun of edgy people
Yeah ight
Not that's spicy
Chopper awesome
Brook is awesome too but what has he done
I disagree chopper played an integral roll in the bigmom amnesia thing
> he secured us our second Road Poneglyph <@153273023456083969>  Nah I mean in Wano
WCI brook a legend
Yeah but Volume 97 almost is
My bad so my point stands why would he be on the cover if he ain't do nothing in 97
Luffy does drink
When he wants to
Case in point romance dawn he drank juice
> Is the last road poneglyph lost <@564773067969265674>  Yeah I'm pretty sure
I'm thinking Elbaf tbh
And maybe sone old Roger pirates will be at Lodestar or something
Dam I called someone a channel nazi in another server and they tried getting me banned
Bruh what's wrong with people
It's a joke referring to the fact that people are too strict over something as stupid as a Discord channel
That'd be epic
Kaido dragon with a sword
We need a cube reader tho
Fuck
Jack is such a cool idea tbh
A fishman zoan user
Nah that was just a weird peramicia
I can't spell for shit my bad boys
Yeah I can ace a standardized test but a spelling test I'm garbage
When the ap literature test said they weren't checking spelling
W

Epic cover
Pugs

Forgot to crop it lmao
Sanji using a gun is so good
Kicks and gunshots
Damn that's sick
Garp Piece
<:Garpathetic:454408355109273600>
Lmao
Tbh idk what would be more interesting out of the 3 Ds
Each a huge part of the 3 main factions of the world
What faction will Luffys child end up in?
If he has one*
Lmao
Maybe politician 👀
A pacifist D
Focus on Revere and stuff
Dealing with the long after math of however this story ends
> if luffy marries vivi , then maybe <@328936254978916352>  Yeah lol that's where I was drawing from
Manga politics is cool add
I've only read kingdom
Oh shit did I just say that? Where's the <#206841928019476491> police at

Controversial drawing
Does this prove the power structure between the straw hats?!?
Not even gonna lie tho Zoro jaw and teeth probably stronger than most humans on our earth
Yeah he just flexes
<:ZoroHUH:701663617229127751>
Why do people think that zoro's scared eye will be relevant
Why do people think overused anime troupes translate to one piece
Yeah I agree
We know a few things about BB
One is that he's going for as many devil fruits as possible
Who is the person literally mass producing devil fruits?
The person that now finds themselves in the middle of a war
Perfect BB opportunity just like marineford
I just thought of something
Do smile fruits regrow after their user dies like normal ones do?
Lmao
Ight I'm back after watching Jinbei vs Moria
Jinbei did 2 shot him and while I won't deny that win at all Moria did underestimate him
Jinbei probably my fave strawhat now tbh
Yeah I like that Oda pointed out that he's more mature than most of the crew and stuff
Sawyer only appears when a war happens
Pre time skip vice admiral level
Actually tho
Do you think all the vice admirals had haki before the time skip?
Yeah ik all of them need to have haki but idk if that was always true or if that's something that war mongering Akainu changed when he became the leader
Yeah it would be cool if Dragon wasn't super strong
What
<@683663101186277416>  Me too but I'm just gonna say Oda said it
Brook so fucking op in WCI
Sanjitards on instagram say Sanji fought Oven so he's the second strongest on the crew but then Brook also fought him 👀
LMAO Vegito
> Why would people say Sanji is the second strongest because he fought Oven <@283276421470748673>  Because they compare it to Zoro fighting Killer
"Zoro got knocked out bro he can't even fight someone like killer"
Also I have a genuine question
Brooks cold powers are from his devil fruit right?
I mean I love both but Sanji being overly sexual makes me like zoro more
A bunch of people told me Brooks powers aren't from his devil fruit
Amd I genuinely thought it was
His cold powers
All his ice related stuff
I thought it was pretty obvious it was because he says things like the cold of hell and stuff
I mean Killer and Zoro are literally the only 2 supernova none captains for a reason
Luffy and Kid have the same dream
!powerscaling
Why doesn't that exist
Thank you
Wow I'm asking the same question
Oda draws obvious lines, "nah bro straw hats legit strongest crew in universe"
Sanji fought kizaru in opening? Sanji yonko level  🥵
Exactly
Yes
Nami > Zoro
Lmao that's true tho
I mean what's the 2nd most recent one it has online
That shit kinda fire tbh I used to play rank as Marco and merk everyone
Wtf
Jinbei Vs Zoro & Sanji
<@683663101186277416> I genuinely hope everyone is memeing but ik everyone isn't
Tbh honest tho in a world where people with powers have the weakness of water, someone who can control start kinda sick bro
> I know what will solve all our issues. **I'LL** beat Kaido <@274366418223497217>  Thanks Zeph 😔🙏
What did I miss of importance
Any super cool powers scaling conclusions made?
> <@!521783526878609418> Chouchou<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<Akainu <@415999229564157955>  Lmao huh u got the symbol backwards
Chouchou > Roger
Proof?
Chouchou protected his owners store, Roger didn't
When you give me Manga evidence of Roger protecting his dead owners store then we'll talk
Till then Chouchou
Aight fun question cause idk what's happening
1 devil fruit go
In real life
Not one piece world
For me it's the Phoenix fruit
No one has haki in real life
So I mean no death
You can fly
And you have tallens
Amd you have fire
What model lmao
Buddha?
Or just normal
👀
Ope ope is my second pic
Lmao you become more enlightened
Nah yo pp increases in size
The pewdiepie pewdiepie no mi
Well yeah homie law served his purpose

Yeah even if you don't train with marcos fruit like bruh healing fire
Yeah for the real world
Zoro fans coming with the nothing happened
I'm Zoro fans
There's a lot tbh that's tuff
Easier to do per character and even then it's not easy
Per arc even gets hard when you have 2 year long arcs lmao
BB is either gonna turn out to be a super amazing character with huge depth or Oda will just go nah he just bad guy
!hack
Pudding better come back tbh
I really thought she'd be integral to Sanji overall character but instead he's off looking for prostitutes
No
Spoiler chat
Yeah
It's a ruff death too
Nothing painless
Yeah same
Yes bro Kaido moon
<:ZoroNut:632474447462400010>
LMAO chapter 1 type vibes
He said he had a few helpers that draw that background and non important stuff
I read the sbs he said that in when it came out lmao
He has to release a chapter a week I'm happy he has help il
Imagine he didn't have help at all? We'd have even more breaks
Most?
Ever heard of luffy

Literary google it
I read an article about mangacas and how hard they work and Oda having helpers was a key part in it
The article I read doesn't state a source for it so that's not useful at all lmao
Tbh the classic Shonen: X ability improves power but will shorten their life span
It comes down to do we think oda will be like every other shonen mangaca and ignore it
Or actually stay true to the words of the manga
The hormones said that tho
I mean it's up to interpretation for sure and while I love oda, I think this is one of the few times he used a shonen troupe which isn't bad just not normal for him
Yeah at the point it doesn't affect the story at all
It isn't really a theory
It's more of a interpretation of what the manga says
And yeah the hormone thing literally said it
But I don't think it'll affect the story
One piece deserves spin offs just not in the future
Oda writing stories of Garp and Dragon
He said he wanted to do it
Let Oda do it
Nah I think Jinbei has been so close to death so many times that it's too obvious
Why should X die? Well because he's gonna die!
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
<@742532068608704532> sorry buddy but uh
Bad opinion
Yes as I am with every death
I didn't go Pedro? Ha knew it what a death vive character
Why
He has deep bond with Luffy
Y'all racist against Fishman
Lmao idk
He's had like a quarter of the arcs in one piece
You should've got used to him in marine ford lmao
Yeah it's almost like he has a life besides the crew which makes him seem more like a real person
More than... Carrot 👀
Bro if u feel that way about Jinbei but then tell me carrot should join
I'll leave this server I swear
What
WHAT
HUH?
<:WBeardWhat:638862189771620372>
Oh I thought u said she has more of a chance than jenbei
Yeah uh icebreaker explain bro
!speedreader2
Bro jenbei who?
Never heard of em
What he was in marineford? What's that? Ooh that white beard ace thing? Yeah ig it was ight
Have you seen WCI tho? 👀
Lmao
Barely saving someone isn't killing them
Wtf
Like he's been such an integral character to Luffy becoming more mature
Who snapped Luffy out of it when he was being a lil bitch boy?
Jinbei
<:JinbeiThug:695550217272950814>
I think Jinbei is a better character because he hasn't been with the crew
Imagine you have a whole life and huge amounts of responsibility for an entire RACE of people, you can't be selfish and just go ight I'm leaving to join luffy idc what happens good look
I'm still not sure why you don't like him tho
Not you like icebreaker

Look at that face
How's that not fun
He's laughing and having a great time
Fleebles bring in the Jinbei love too
> I just find him boring. He decides for the crew. He just doesn’t fit imo. <@742532068608704532>  Wdym he decides for the crew?
<@474659436804177930> Nah Icebreaker is completely against Jenbei while Bigbluepokes slightly against him
Huh?
You know Luffys rival Capone LMAO
No general statements with no reasoning behind them been put out by u but that's still better than Icebreaker saying stuff that doesn't make sense
What does that mean tho
Homes none your points made sense you said he almost killed luffy because he didn't save him enough <:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
Bro Nurses? They kill people constantly wtf
Cap
The biggest cap
Him and luffy literally love each other
Jinbei has better chemistry with people than most of the crew now
You mean when all the women hated him
And half the crew was scared of him
Huh?
You read Robin and Jinbei
I have no problem with people having an argument but like say a reason behind your points
That's how a debate works
Facts fats
Can we get a !fats where it just says facts
Idk what makes him boring tbh
Y'all see that joke zoro made? LMAO
I think it's literally the fact that he's been gone so long
But also I love that
Zoro smiled
This argument is over Zoro smiled
If Zoro smiled to a nakama joining like that
It means something
Bad chemistry, oda literally writes "what a moral boost"
Literally had the responsibility of an entire SPECIES of people on his shoulders
Out of the crew Jinbei probably one of THE most important people
The Knight of the Sea
> in terms of what? <@372464153480134666>  Is this @ me?
Because the responsibility of the protection of the fishmen species has been on his shoulders for decades
Oh yeah I meant like compared to the other people on it
Not on the crew itself, I meant on the crew as compared to the others
Like if Nami died an entire species of people wouldn't go bruh
Icebreaker you're so cool for blindly hating someone without any actual reasoning 😔
We got a super cool troll boys
Everyone praise him
There's a difference between not getting someone and saying him dying would be your favorite arc 💀
Can we just some Yamato love in the chat
Where the yamato emojis at 😔

Yes
This meme proves it
I don't tbh that's a lil too op
Making plot armor to a real thing
If Law was close to momo he would give it to him
But Law isn't really close to anyone but Luffy and his crew
I can't think of anyone he'd perform the surgery on besides Luffy or his crew
But that probably wouldn't happen
Nah if someone he really cares about is about to die I'd see him doing it
<#206841928019476491>
Go there icebreaker
I'm not a channel nazi tho don't get me wrong but if people are in da middle of a convo about one-piece they're probably not gonna switch to my hero
I don't like channel nazis but for the sake of people replying your best bet is there
Well everyone was just talking about luffys life being shortened by the hormones
Maybe that would cancel the affects
I don't think it'll happen but that's the best reason I can think of tbh
Same
Yeah like I said earlier it's one of the few times Oda used a Shonen troupe
And did nothing different with it
Power levels was one of those times but he made it unique
Enies loby was an arc of shonen troupes lmao
Nah a fighting tournament isn't really a troupe and more of a thing that's just a martial arts thing, and it wasn't even a normal japanese martial arts tourny it was a colloseom gladiator thing
So even then he still did it fairly differently
Oh I'm not saying troupes are bad and people shit on them too much
But Oda usually doesn't use them is all
Lmao
Ok
Yeah there was also a lot of stuff happening in the country at large
The tournament arc also wasn't: main character strong so main character fight
It was that's my dead brothers will
It wasn't bad writing it's just a common troupe of saying a strong technique hurts your body by using t because it was so strong and they can't handle the power
That's just how manga is
Well I mean we know at least the gear third problems were fixed
At the end of the day it was never stated that gears shorten his life span
It was stated they have a toll on his body
Ive been in a lot of car accidents, that has taken a heavy toll on my body but that doesn't necessarily mean my life is shorter than if I didn't have the accident
Yeah the complete control of instant gear 2 and use of it so perfectly is also a good reason to assume that he doesn't has a toll on his body anymore
It also was never stated about life span tho
Lucci said its a toll on his body
Did he? I'm pretty sure he just said toll
Ik the hormones for sure mentioned it
IDK if we on the same topic
But
At least this translation stated only Luffy was "hacking away at his life"

Not that he was shortening his life span
I think Oda left this vague on purpose
But also this is one translation
And again it's up for interpretation
I love Tekking
But that doesn't make him Oda
Tekking is a genuinely good person and one of my favorite YouTubers
But he has made videos that were proven wrong multiple times
He isn't a god just a good guy
So again let us not just take his words as fact I haven't watched that Lifespan vid since it came out so idek what he says but either way let's not just take that as canon
Nah I think he's an actual compassionate guy that loves people
Lmao
Remember that time Oda made Shanks lose his arm chapter 1
There's literally a ton of different reasons tbh
If we're going with actual science
Literally a different gravity could cause extended life span from what Nasa has seen
Well that's different that's from the quality of life increasing
That doesn't happen in the one piece world
Bruh we back to this
I still say it could be more than 1 or 1
It doesn't have the perfect evidence
But until someone says there's 1 moon
Then ig we don't know for sure
Ohara mostly
Yeah but again there's planets in the real world with multiple moons but you can only see one at a time
The Oharans thought so
I'm no a provacater for this theory
I'm just saying either way we can not be 100%
It does already
Ok now a common disregard to this is the geocentric argument
Which I disagree with 110%
I personally think there's 1 moon
But thinking that the literal smartest and most study people in the world were geocentric when they have very advanced tech is dumb
Moons can have moons too
Moon moons are not impossible
This is also a world void of logic
> there is no way to see that the earth goes around the sun from earth <@202087725833125889>  Yes there is, by this logic we would be geocentric until we had satellites in space lmao
That's the geocentric thing I was talking about,
With the basic technologies of the one piece world they should know the earth isn't the center of the universe
Yes with your eyes but using basic technology and looking at how things in the sky work you can tell we aren't the center
In real life people knew we weren't the center over a century before the pirate age
Yeah but we figured it out with technology that the oharans have
I'm not saying there's multiple moons
But I am saying the Oharans are dumb enough to think that Earth is the center of the universe
> It's a one-off drawing to fit the theme of Oharans being scholars, and that's literally it <@186562609254891520>  I agree 100%
But saying the Oharans are geocentric kinda makes no sense when looking at technology and science but also it's the one piece world
Like if this was a random island than yeah the geocentric theory makes a lot of sense
But this is Ohara, the people known across the world for being smart
> <@!521783526878609418> maybe they're studying how the ancient people thought about space. Lack of imagination from your part <@415999229564157955>  No someone actually said this yesterday and it's my head canon and what I'm going with tbh
That makes the most sense to me
Yeah but that's like specific places
I'm talking about the knowledge available to the widest amount of places that the Oharans who travel the world would know
Like the basic stuff
That's why if they were just an island of scientist and not famous and world travelers the geocentric would work
Also not to suck off Oda but he does do things sometimes that fit with the real life pirate era
My head canon is that they're studying what people of the past thought
Because these just aren't people in 1 place
Yeah fats thats why I'm just going with like what the basic citizens have because I'm not gonna pretend like Oharans were vegapunk level lmao
Like Oharans traveled that's a big part of it for me
But also multiple moons is kinda dumb and even if there was the excuses needed to make go explain it would make it irrelevant to the story in the first place
I think there's 1 moon
But I also don't think Oharans are geocentric lmao
Yeah but 500 years ahead of what?
Any island not affiliated with the world gov has a different level of tech
> <@!521783526878609418> Little Garden <@415999229564157955>  Exactly lmao
World gov controlled islands from what we see all have like the same basic levels of basic late pirate era tech
Some have more or less but that can be chalked up to the amount of money on the island
Any non affiliated island
Literary could have anything
Not in normal marine controlled islands
The marines themselves yeah cause of vegapunk
But Wow the more tech you give them the more it proves they aren't geocentric hehehe
Go ahead Germa confuses me too a lot
The germa comic didn't exist before Sanji was born right?
They based it off of the kids right?
So maybe out of respect of their "dead son" they made stealth black a character
I see but things like communication exist because of a natural thing that isn't on earth, and anything involving Vega punk I won't dispute because I think the Government purposely doesn't let the world have his tech and same with aviation
Our earth I should say
We don't have snail boys
But when it comes to things like houses, farming, boats, weapons, and the main things that every day citizens of the world government see are all relatively the same era of technology
> But then thats headcanon Alex because avaiation would extremely beneficial for the military to have. Also the snails have been showed to be hacked and tampered and also changed to fit the designs of characters. They clearly have some advancements in hacking or tampering with comminication which is something that took us a lonnnggg while to get to<@521783526878609418> <@683663101186277416>  The aviation is headcanon you're right but assuming in our world if we also had the same communication snails as the one piece world we wouldn't have developed it much earlier is also just assumptions
We can't compare the sea snails because that's different from anything we have in our world tbh
The aviation thing is 100% my head canon tho
Also sorry I'm not keeping up with germa thing
Are the germa comics older than the germa siblings?
Wow the both of us are also trying to compare our two worlds when in their world bodies work differently
I mean the Oharans don't have a reason to do anything
They do the knowledge just for that knowledge
I mean besides navigation unless imu wanted to go to space nothing
But navigation is super connected to astronomy especially during the pirates era
But you also don't need a super good understanding of astronomy for that
Yeah exactly you don't needa know slot lol
To navigate
Still is tbh
To get a boating license and be a professional boating captain for most things you need a basic understanding of astronomy even today just in case your equipment fails
It's not that big a deal because your equipment mostly won't fail
But you still supposed to be able to know the basic stuffs
You actually can't sail unless you know about astrology and your sign and what other signs you're compatible with 🥵
Libra tehehehe
Do compasses exist in one piece?
Yeah probably in the ,4 blues
> <@521783526878609418> yes in the normal seas <@289876647354826752>  Yeah that's what I thought
> <@521783526878609418> you deadass? <@237434464656031744>  I mean logposes aren't normal compasses
Wait I'm dumb
Nami had one
And it didn't work
In the grandline
I remember the scene now lmao
Look its late here I'm half asleep
Friendship
Because
!hack
The one piece is gonna where I finally find people to do a one piece dnd campaign with 😔
I mean racism
They different
So we better
It's a common mentality in uneducated people
> how come no fishmen marines??? <@268569943723868161>  That's actually a good question
You think more would join to try to smooth relations
I mean Jinbei literally joined the warlords basically part of the marines to try to smooth things out
There's racism against all non human races
There's still giant marines
> fishmen were kept as slaves by the saints, they fucking **hate** humans <@244273354222075915>  Yeah until that lady went ham and moved the people's hearts
> They would not allow a fishmen to join the marines <@237434464656031744>  I would agree if the fishmen weren't just eat stronger
It's the same reason there's giants
Even if they're seen as less than humans by the humans they're still an asset
Debatable
I think it's because they don't want to
Not as much that the marines wouldn't use them
The marines even use priates
G5
> what do you guys think hawkins will do in wano? <@736969911573676082>  Can't do anything if they aren't there
Nvm
I thought that said mihawk
Again it's late at night here my bad
Lmao
I read mihawk and thought bruh
Hawkins loyal to his cards
And that's it
Not confirmed
But we think
Damn idk if y'all picked it up
But moria told jinbei when he tried taking his shadow that after he took it then he'd really be stuck at the bottom of the sea with the rest of those fishmen where the sun can't reach
Makes me hate Moria even more now after everything we learned
Moria a bad guy
Just a stinky person
Ugly
Dumby head
<:ZoroWeary:701983967041159169>
Bruh he actually gave it to Roger
Nah jk Moria gave his hat to Joy Boy
Y'all remember Joy Boy
Yeah me neither
Before 10 chapters ago
Not in my memory
Bruh
Maybe he was half giant half fishman
That'd be epic
To get it on with Oden
<@244273354222075915> Wotan from Davie back
Means never heard of it lmao
Marco should be fighting king rn instead of licking lollipop man grrrrr
Marco comes back after years, stands on beach and talks
My mom at the supermarket when she sees her friend
Me and the other ladies son
Man king is cool
Hes a new race
He's edgy
What more do u need?
He has a KATANA
I wonder how many are dead
Most
Probably
Payback war a big yikes 😬
Bruh on God
Every Robin rider
She's so important she's the only one that can read the ponyglyphs
Yeah you're right even we the reader don't know what Robin has read
Why the fuck she on the crew if she doesn't even tell the crew mates what's on the ponyglyphs
She her own historian bruh not even the straw hats
Exactly bro
It's like yeah we know info, can we know it too oda? Nah
Man oda built a whole world filled with so many mysteries
And the one lady who should be solving it all reads the info and doesn't tell us 💀
Legendary beast vibes
> Big mom said if she got Lola to marry Loki that she would have already been pirate king, I think there’s more to that than JUST getting the giants on her side. They may be the key to pluton. The “land” weapon <@345807250109235201>  I disagree this depends on the population of the giant race
Because if there's literally tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands
Bruh it's over
If there's only a couple hundred giants you're probably right tbh
But of the giant island has the population of like a normal island it's over for the marines if they fought
Exactly lmao
It's robin language don't worry
Robin will read it then not tell u what it says
Yeah wait are people saying Pluton isn't a warship?
I thought we were talking about Uranus tbh
Yeah
So do people think the counter to pluton is something that isn't pluton?
Yeah ik I'm confused
I think we're all on the same page but don't realize it lmao
Yup that's what's happening
LMAO I've watched 6 people including myself say the same thing as the person before them
7
Chat confusing sometimes lmao
Bruh are the ponoglyphys just in japanese?
Artur is Robin
Except hotter 👀🥵
It has the word pluton on itn
So younger me didn't think any deeper into it
Damn bruh your name is my reaction to that
> I wonder if Franky did ever memorize the contents of the blueprints <@287712421165137920>  He is a cyborg so maybe
What if Kaido escapes gets pluton then the straw hats need to go to Elbaf to try to get the giants help in creating the pluton copy that franky memorized the blue prints of but then Shanks is there and then cool stuffs happens 😔🙏
Huh?
Strong - Right
It's -
Yeah pretty obvious
Oh no
!headcanon
No
Nah they were just saying what if he memorized it Wow
Because he's cyborg so computer boy
So maybe he memorized it
> FMI is big mom territory , and has a mermaid daughter , she has to have at least heard bout it , them going there will result in a panel of big meme getting eatin by sea kings <:ZoroNut:632474447462400010> <@198930928083402753>  Yes but no, her knowing isn't because of mermaid daughter it's because mud man knows about it and he's a prisoner in wano
> I could always be wrong but I'll look for it Big <@683663101186277416>  Oh I thought we were just theorizing tbh I'm pretty sure Franky never says it
mAyBe
Monkey D who?
!speedreader2 is my favorite
Luffy life span people

My new favorite pic
Yo your kinda memeing too hard
I mean we know
But you hit it kinda hard
Say Kaido blows up the moon
Which moon*
Lmao u read my mind
@Artur which moon kaido blowing up this week 😔

Pug piece poggers
More people there
Everyone going to sleep here
Gotcha
If kissanime doesn't have it I just Google the name of the chapter tbh
Big mom <:ZoroNut:632474447462400010>
Excuses aside I'm actually gonna sleep now lmao GN boys see ya tomorrow
Bruh
Too late for sure
Nah nah the assassin is that super cool looking underworld guy
Yeah but I'm sure the WG hires assassin's and people from the underworld
They legit do underworld slave trading so I'm sure
But luffy 1 shot garp
So
Luffy >>>>>>>>>> Roger
!powerleveling
!powerlevel
Bruh I never remember it
Than you 💀
Lmao
Damn if I was in the one piece world
I'd probably just die
Like just go
And die
Gone bro
Oda ate it
Said yummy yummy Yamato yummy
We've never seen Roger train either tho
He do be stronks
Y'all think we'll ever go to that famous "ice continent"
Sounds like cap coded
Could be true
But sounds like cap
Ice continent has one piece
Nah cap
Lodestar useless
Because the whole point of it is already done
A joke
One piece
Lol bad show
Tekking good
Joy boy is unwatchable to me tbh
Rogers base over reacts to everything tbh
Like 😬
WAAAAH YONKO?!?!?!?
Wa-WHAT
Why did reverie exist if we just never gonna go back to it for like 100 chapters
It's like Robin reading Poneglyphs and not telling anyone what's on it
Oh my bad I meant that actual Reverie
Ik that's also a youtube thing
I don't even know most of these one piece YouTubers tbh
I can't stand watching Rogersbase doing the thing that seizure guy from Avatar does over and over
I can see why a dude who screams and throws his hands around constantly with two half naked women with him can turn weird very fast
Tekking is chill unless he isn't lmao
Then he's kind crazy
Like the Brick was funny at first
But when the brick has been around for this long  👀
I agree Tekking is literally like a real friend
> No, Tekking cant stop screaming in my ears <@274366418223497217>  Just skip past the first minute
Tekking post intro is great
I mean I like tangents tbh
The worst cringe that is unbearable is always in the beginning
I usually just skip it and it's a great video
Like haha Break special affects haha weird break
Which I enjoy more than a 20 minute video of reading a script
Yeah I'd rather watch teking go on tangents than someone boringly say points for a few minutes with no actual personality
I watch videos for entertainment tekking does that
Yeah for sure curious
I've never seen him
Nux is tekking + Rogers base
Hes literally them combined
With a lil bit of 2spooky
hElLo
I like podcast but a one piece podcast sounds kinda 😬
Artur is Odas son confirmed?!?
Yeah tekkings name is matt
Wait wtf
He was tryna spoil mark?
I'll fucking kill them
Totally not mark is such a precious thing
A childish glow
Ah so just the joke of "haha u not caught up so I spoil"
This week
Yeah zeph he's just going on a week break
He's still probably doing post marine ford after the break
That seems like a lot to cover
Yeah but Marine ford has more substance and emotional value than those too arcs combined
Some were good tho
Ending 1 is literally a master piece
As a kid, I never stopped Searching for a great treasure I had a map in my mind That I knew would lead me
Fire
Oh no is the pacing bad?
I'm finally gonna watch the anime again
Don't tell me the pacing is bad in wano 😬
> get ready for yonko level batman <@!521783526878609418> <@703504844903940096>  You mean Apoo?
Oh you literally mean the batman
Like the smileuser
Wtf
I barely even remember him lmao
<:WBeardWhat:638862189771620372>  is what I would say if I've heard them
But I haven't heard them so idk
Yeah I'd say a lil less than 1
DBZ be like .01 chapters per episode
Do big mom's children all have daddy issues?
Daddy perospero 🤤
Well that's why you have Daddy issues because of the lack there of one
Well sometimes
No male role model type vibes
I mean sometimes
It could also be from having a shitty dad
Artur is basically Morgan's
I think the way it works is either the government puts a bounty on you and they pay for it or probably another group can be the ones to pay for the bounty set on you by the government and they could also probably decide dead or alive, dead only, or alive only as they're the ones paying for it not the WG
The bounties can't be decided by you but you could probably decide to be the one to pay for it if you're rich enough and decide on the status of it
I think theres boards of people that review what people do and decide bounties not people like the admirals
And I'm sure the WG can raise them if they think that they need to be dealt with asap
So they didn't know Garp was dragons dad
Wouldn't that raise suspension about Garp if his son is THE most wanted man alive
> Sengoku told garp that if he wasn’t the hero of the marines then He woulda been held responsible for the actions of his family <@564773067969265674> Ah that makes sense
Wait
Let me ask a big brain question
Didn't they know dragons last name?
Did they know garps?
Nah the Navy
Yeah that makes way more sense
But they knew Luffys name
So everyone knew immediately that he was Garps grand son
So Dragons wanted poster probably didn't have Monkey D until after Marineford
Idk I'm sure they still knew his name tbh
Im tryna see Dragon wanted poster still 😔
Bruh I'm dumb
I just spead read that pannel
!speadreader2
Nah
Nah stop
My Luffy X Yamato was just ruined
Might kms not sure
Will lyk
I mean fodder is fodder but Zoro vs all the marine fodder at marineford
I'd still give it to the Marines
All of em fone
An army of fodder isn't fodder anymore tbh
Nah sinji just goes sKy wAlK and eats shit and dies
Yeah you right
But an army of fodder is stronger than most non fodder characters
Strawhat grand fleet isn't even a grand fleet because it doesn't even exist
It's literally months travel away from each otherb
How the fuck they gonna act quickly if something happens
Luffy one sec bro let me circumnavigate half of the grandline
Give me half an arc bro
Ideo cool
Y'all shit on Ideo but will argue me to death about a fucking jacket I swear to fucking god
A cool different race of people long armed boxer that can make things explodes with his FIST? Nah bro this man is a jacket and trust jackets can force themselves onto someone believe me I'm a sentient jacket myself
I like him just because he's a long arm and I like the idea of all the races under Luffys command
Also boom boom fist kinda epic
!hack
Ideo has a cool design tho tbh
Jumped on the wiki and he kinda epic bro
Ignore my bookmark bar
Ideo more of a satisfying design than most dressrosa characters
Dressrosa was The age of the Fodder
Homie has a unique way of using his long arms unlike any other long arm we've seen
Ideo > Orlumbus
If Orlumbus didn't have an army of fodder he'd literally be a big dude who goes bowling
Mr. 5 is one of the best characters in one piece
On ChouChou level tbh
What else he gonna chose?
His explosions hurt him no?
Oh then why doesn't he just blow up his fist like Ideo
I always thought the reason he threw his boggys was because it'd hurt him
Explosive headbutts
When is Ace getting out of Impel Down tho
He's been there so long
I mean he has the blue fire
Would look even cooler tbh
Nah Logias can't hurt themselves
Nah thriller bark
Vs Ryuma
Unless you wanna call that just a heat attack that set Ryuma on fire
That he didn't actually create the fire
And just heat
Ichiji powers kinda wack tbh I didn't fully get it
Yeah the anime made it blue
Ig it could've been red
But in my mind it's blue
There could also be chemicals on Ryuma dead body that would turn the fire a different color
Wait no one answered my question a while back
Brooks cold powers from his devil fruit right?
Because instagram spead readers attacked me for thinking that
Said it was "his sword from the devil people"
Like bro you know those swords that give you ice powers like huh?
Exactly Fleeb
That was my argument
But they were like no bro the devil worshippers gave him that power
!speedreader2
Its not even headcanon if it's explained to be wrong
LMAO
Yeah
Right after thriller bark is when I switched from anime to manga
I reread until then at some point
And watched up to Zou too
I watched most of WCI but not all I read it weekly but couldn't watch it all
Joyboy voice makes me feel no good
I also didn't like a video he made like years ago so I just never watched it
Yeah I like his art style
Makes sense that's why you're shit
Or the art he uses my bad
It matches his pfp so cool theme thing
Wait what
That's a bruh moment
Is he even a mink tho tbh he just a monkey
Like it's just a monkey with a hat
Mink are humanoid animals
This monkey thing is just a monkey with clothes on
Ah fair enough
But still this monkey just a monkey
> Yamato can read poneglyphs from studying Odens Journal <@521427565492305931>  Damn maybe when she reads it she'll actually tell us what's on them unlike fucking Robin
Yamato replace Robin? 🤤 Yes please
Nah he just crouching
He T bagging luffys dead grandma
Why u think Garp so mad for
Xebec just no scoped his girl
If Robin is luffys step mom I'll leave
Like not the chat just everything
I'll just leave
!fodder
Someone make that
That was the best one piece pun I've ever heard
Lmao

Me when I see a sanjitard
Top 5 weakest scientist?
Nah
Garp was a good dad just not strict
So he did the opposite with Luffy and beat the shit out of him
I don't remember if it's a bib or not but I remember it looking like a cigar
I think it's just oda drawing cool or like powerful eyes
I don't think they're connected
Hakuba confirmed Mihawk and Imu sun
My bad bro
Lmao
Imu Sama? Tbh he's like mid warlord level maybe low admiral high yonko 6th commander type strength
I mean it's literally in his epithet
Hawkeye
Caribou Celestial?!?
I think it's just Oda going "I draw eye like this"
!hack
There's some things that I think are seeds set by Oda but some eyes idk
That I can see a connection with
Mihawk and Hakuba not so much
And Mihawk had the epithet I think that's the extent of that
The zunesha and Imu thing has a much stronger link that I wouldn't be surprised if ran seller
Nah Zunesha been wondering before the void century I'm pretty sure
Yeah and that's why he won't get it because it'd be so good
I think the sensing the presence thing isn't an ussop exclusive like someone said
Yeah someone either here or on instagram said it was a unique thing like katakuri future sight and it was a speed reader moment
Yeah it's just how Oda represented it at that moment
Yeah I got that feel too Costa
Nah I think literally everyone can
I think it's just how it was represented in that moment
I'm sure if Sanji was in Ussops place he could also see them
Them being sugar
Yeah exactly
Idk the specialities thing doesn't really sit right with me I think someone can train it more than others but I think any of the monster trio could have seen what Ussop saw in that moment
Yeah and maybe during Wano
My ex played softball and could flex her cheeks
😔
Sad times
Gonna go kaido myself to sleep
It's kaido times boys
I gotta stop myself from saying chef stuff
It's so easy to go on culinary tangents
Salt piece
Damn I rushed to find my favorite dessert but could only find a pic of like half of it and you guys aren't even on dessert anymore
😔 sad stuff
Blue
All?
Blue
All blue?
Someone call sanji and tell em it's right here in this server
No way I know Oda
@Artur
Sanji and Zoro are kinda just Strawhat fodder tbh
Oh they fought the unimportant 2nd and 3rd strongest
Wow how cool
Ussop? Character development
Chopper? Perfect
What an I saw I'm a literary genius myself f
Suuuuuper
Yeah obviously
Ben who?
You mean 800 chapters ago
Relevant people only please
Lmao what
Joy boy in spanish
Huh
How can I be fodder if I'm the main character of my own life <:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
<:ZoroWeary:701983967041159169>
People who say Sanji is a good character !speedreader2
Fuxk
FUCK
Aight I failed I'm done for tonight

That's me
I'm so scared
Thank u jugol
!speedreader2 is better because it takes up less space lmao
Smaller boy helps convo stay readable for me
Wtf is happening
Sanji also is over sexualized
PROSTITUTES?!? Sorry Wano war I have better things to do <:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
Bruh even a nosebleed troupe here and there isn't that that annoying
But when he's legit a sexually predator 😬
Imagine if Sanjis character was more focused on his cooking stuff and his cool side
He would be way better
But instead we get predator chef
Yeah it's over some for no reason
As a chef Sanji would be probably my favorite anime character if he actually was a chef and not a sexual predator that sometimes cooks
Yeah I mean we could chalk it up to Japan having a different culture and sense of humor around sexualization
But idk even then 😬
Sanji:" I spent 2 years training not only my fighting skills like the other monster trio but my actual cooking skills and am able to create dishes that might change the way a fight goes because it can boost people's physical abilities" *comes back to crew See's a woman never does anything else
Like bruh the fact he did more than do fighting training is so cool
Then oda went
Nah
Boobs
Legit such a cool concept at least to me especially with the whole point being to boost people's physical abilities
Nah the recipes weren't just normal food
They were supposed to be like secret enhancing foods
Once since the time skip?
He spent the time skip learning that
Imagine if luffy used haki twice
That's why I don't remember the punk hazard one
I don't even remember the punk hazard one
And I had no idea about the cake cream
It just is a really cool concept especially when fighting a yonko crew to give them some sort of edge over them
Lmao
Puns
I don't remember either tbh
But still twice in non important ways
If they just had the cake filling be normal cake filling that wouldn't have changed anything
The punk hazard thing sounds more relevant tbh but I can't remember so I'ma look that one up
Yeah the first one sounds like a good example tbh
But the cake thing is literally just cake filling
Ive always enjoyed the aspect of sanji that is he's not a fighter
Can he fight? Yes
Is that his goal? No
So the idea of him being able to make these 99 recipes that can completely change the way a fight goes is so cool to me
Yeah the cake thing kinda dumb tbh
The punk hazard one works
But that's still only 2 in the like 8 years since the time skip
Something being so sweet to take someone out isn't a cool recipe that can physically enhance the crew to change the way a fight goes
And if that didn't exist the arc wouldn't have gone any different at all
Literally just say Sanji made a good filling
Why would they just randomly eat it? And he's also never used it like that
I mean if he used it like that
Then that would be awesome
But he just hasn't
I would love to see him do that > <@!521783526878609418> It can decrease enemy forces <@415999229564157955>
But the fact that it's not a relevant thing in post time skip sanji sucks
I agree I meant the way he used it didn't seem as relevant as the punk hazard one
Imagine an arc where sanji was a serious character? That's one of the reasons why I like WCI tbh
Sanji wasn't a gag throughout the whole thing
The majority of the arcs? No
Like time wise in each arc I mean
Getting serious for like 1 fight and spending the whole time going 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
I mean Wano is an extreme example so I won't really use that
Like that's more of an outlier tbh
Leaving the raid for prostitutes
Yeah and when he does I like it
But it doesn't happen until key moments in arca
Arcs*
He's either goofy or just existing
I mean Luffy as well
But his goofy isn't creepy
I think the type of goofy is the problem
Is sneaking into a women's bath while naked goofy or just being a sexual predator?
Sanjis an adult
Not a child
He's a strawhat
I mean I agree
I like the pirates have loose morals
But it's a shonen and the reoccurring theme is that the straw hats are different
#Yamato>Carrot
😴
Let's not go off giving Oda head
Dam
I built different
I wasn't
I mean he's a grand fleet member that's good enough
More barto is good I agree but him joining the straw hats themselves would be lil too much
His gag would grow to be too annoying
Marco strawhat?
Nah jk lmao
Yeah Jinbei fills that roll
I think more characters will join the grandfleet then crew
Carrot a grand fleet commander to me
Yamato girl then marries luffy
Yeah I think so
Vega such a non character character
Yeah bro this guy you've never seen in the 21 year long manga exist but he's so smart and can do literally everything
Vegapunk is like a shadow that we all know exist and will probably meet one day
We just accept it and ignore the shadow
Sword
Reinforcements
> Does sword have the ssg weapons? <@683663101186277416>  I don't think so
> Do you guys think any of the straw hats would eat a devil fruit <@346692838328893452>  Monet fruit theory still cool
> Why would they come to Wano? <@683663101186277416> they have dealings with wano, it's their source for seaprism probably
I'm not 100 on them coming but I don't think it's impossible
The WG have
And the WG control the marines
CP meeting with Orochi to make deals
They trade
That wasn't the first time they were there tho
They have traded in the past
That's how orochi got ships and guns and stuff
Nah he literally says the WG got him ships and weapons
It's in the CP meeting
The WG doesn't really need money tho
This happened so long ago so I literally can't remember what the CP asked for
Orochi wanted Vega in return
Yeah no lol but that's what he wanted
We know that Wano is a huge sea prism  stone place so it would make some sense if the Navy got it from there but that's just my head canon
I think BB makes more sense than the navy
I think some 3rd party will appear towards the end
BB or Shanks makes more sense than the Navy to me
Yeah and shanks coming would lead into the final safa
But also that's a marine ford repeat
Wouldn't be surprised would be sad
Pudding gets kidnapped by BB
Because no one there to protect her besides Kat
Kat teams up with straw hats to fight BB along side bigmom troops that support Kat
Nothing's Necessary it's a manga
This is all about what's likely
And as a shonen the older generation fan favorite character is shanks which means he immediately has a higher chance of dying
Big mom territory attack would work for that
A Katakuri luffy team up against BB would be sick
Luffy for his brother Kagakuri for his sister
Doflamingo?
He knows secrets
> ok doffy keeps saying "oh there is this secret" why not just tell it? > he is already locked up. <@212265078739828737>  He has more power by not just saying it
I think he's gonna kidnap Pudding
She's a third eye tried
^
Especially if BB wants that secret too so he helps him get out in exchange for the secret
Yeah probably not but it's better than no power
Also who's he gonna tell the secret to in impeldown?
Lmao yeah
Yeah I think a BB kidnaping Pudding, so Katakuri needs to attack him but doesn't have enough fire power to right a yonko crew so he asks Luffy for help and Luffy obviously agrees after Ace would be an amazing Last Saga kick off before the end end, anything with BB would also attract Shanks.
BB caused Ace death
Luffy fighting him for his brother Kat for his sister
I think a relationship between Kat and pudding would've been cooler than with brulee
Battle royal all the one piece youtubers who lives?
Bonus round including Artur and Oda
Garp didn't betray the organization he's worked for for more than half a century?!?
It makes more sense that he didn't save him than if he did
What's more important a promise or literally the thing he's dedicated his entire life to?
Would you throw away your entire life over a promise with a deadman?
Bro we talking about science if this a tekking video
> <@521783526878609418> if that was the case then he didn't have to take Ace under his wing <@631190162566676480>  Taking Ace as his grandson doesn't do against his entire lifes career
The sins of a father don't transfer to the child
But then Ace became an actual pirate
He had his own crimes
Yeah and he also tried forcing them into the marines so they wouldn't become pirates
Garp worked hard so bother Luffy and Ace wouldn't be defined by their fathers crimes, but both ignored Garp and allowed themselves to be difened by their OWN grimes
Garp good guy
He gets shit but that discussion destroyed him
Yeah if science applied then the one piece world would only have 1 moon
👀
What?
Who Bartos? No
Kizarus light attacks are physical lazers
If you get a strong material that happens to be see through and shoot it with a lazer then it doesn't just go through
Lasers don't work off of sight they are a physician force
There's a difference between refraction off of something like a mirror an a material just being transparent
Bartos barrier is transparent doesn't mean a lazer goes through but
This is so conpli
I'm probably gonna start a a one piece dnd campaign soon if anyone in here what's to join lmk
Lmao are u for real or playing?
Can we start a good argument in here like some jacket jacket fruit stuff
One that boils on for like half an hour and really gets people going
He is
Ussop cute 🤤
Haha xd just playing tehehehe
Lmao
Too sarcastic for this channel?
Well
He drinks
And he uh fights yonkos? And he stops wars
I'd say shanks is actually the manifestation of power scalers as an actual character and his goal is to keep balance among the power scaling
For the sake of power scaling
Can't have Kaido being pirate king level
Only yonko lebel
He keeps balance in the scales
!fish
Nah I wanna fish
!fish
!adventure new
7
Nah
<:ShanksYes:727411684095819856>
Unless you're a girl then he tries to sexually assault u
Wym bruh Zoro literally bathes all the time
You ain't see his ass training in water falls ever 5 minutes bruh that's  freshwater that's clean shit
Luffy and zoro are very different
Chopper smells like fresh meat
Ussop smells like BITCH
Franky smells like America
Shit
Just shit
A bad person
The fresh winds of a summer that doesn't even do their one job on the ship
Poneglyph? You mean the thing that I'm here for because I can read them? Yeah I'm not gonna tell anyone on my crew what it says 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Robin quirky 🤪
Like a manly fish
Like a shark
Testosterone + Fish
Testosterone
They have insane amounts of it
Brook would bath but he doesn't have skin to wash because he's just a bag of bones! yohohoho
Sanji is disgusting
Sanjitard 🤮
Sanji literally would rape a woman
Sanji wanted to do the same thing
!speesreader2
!speedread2
Fuck
I can never do it
I'm too dumb
Did I type spees? LMAO
Bruh moment
Speed typed be like 😔
Don't they eat the fish from their?
Sustainable farm fishing?
Yamato always bathing, in Odens glorry 😔
What
Huh
😬
I'm a yamato fan boy and even I don't think of her armpits
👀
Eyes
Always
The windows into the soul
Everything you needs know about someone from their ey w
That's how I know Mihawk a celestial dragon bro
Eyes 😔
When we get to the one piece and oda lied and it is just the friendship they shared along the way 😔

King according to who Oda? LMAO the hack
!hack
Nah he did say it
But he's also a hack
Omg
I haven't laughed that hard in a minute
Looks like a 1st grader
Oda what's happened
Robin the bad historian
The I won't share any information I find on these legendary poneglyphs we've found together Robin?
I'm at 1% good bye men
Been a good life with all of u
It's not even the feet
It's just the toes
Nvm
I looked at Odens
Maybe it's like my hero and special people have special toes
Wait did I just make a comment on another show?!?
<#206841928019476491> police
Thank you bro 😔
It's ok ik the consequences
I die here
But scars on a one piece fans back are a shame
So only my front 😔
Tried to*
Big Akainu assumptions there
I came up with an epic story for my one piece dnd I'm excited boys
No that would go against luffys main characteristics
Luffy doesn't have to become a boring planner for have matured
There's a difference between maturing in someone's own way and becoming a different character
Luffy will never be law
But luffy is also more mature than he was when he started
Gaben that's tuff
Just use a phone bro
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
Cringhe cringe
Got em 😎 typo
It kinda looks like him tbh
But also did u see marco in the chapter
He didn't look like a fucking human at all
That was a demonic creature not marco
Im just saying we can't deduce either way for sure because oda is a hack
Like someone send the marco and pero pannel
It's legit curvy lines
Bruh
Wtf
Homie that shit is 6ft long
Literally everyone in jump force is ugly
Jump force isn't a pretty game
Or a good game
An cc one piece game would be amazing
Xenoverse 2 is vastly superior to Jump force tbh
I'm not a xenoverse fan boy but it's just better
A one piece xenoverse would samck
That's too good
The thing of dreams
I mean everyone also wanted a naruto CC
But then it happened
And 😬
Yeah sea of thieves is good now
But as someone who played the early beta
Bruh moment
Even the released version
Bruh
Y'all wanna go get a chest? Yeah. Y'all wanna do it again? Yeah. Again? Yeah 😔.
I mean yeah but also crews in sea of thrives are actual players no Npc
I like that better
Tbh the open world one piece game wasn't bad
The difficulty setting was dumb tbh
It was either insanely easy
Or insanely hard in some areas
When u play as Zoro and Sabo I mean
Luffy was always easy mode
Nah Mip even in the hardest difficulty it's straight up boring at times
Like legit there's areas that are ok I did it
Yeah I think so
And then u walk into an areas and go oh when did I die?
I don't remember I got the season pass I think
I think law is out so I'ma try him actually
Release was 60
Idk about now
Also all the dlc is like built in basically
So the downloads for it are 10 MB
Ima play world seekers rn
Idk PW never really my thing didn't play it
But open world is so world seekers was amazing to me
Should I get PW4?
Isn't the game play just killing fodders?
Yeah looks kinda boring tbh
A custom character game would be epic
But also I don't want it to be, you join straw hats cool
Shinobi strikers was such a good skeleton but terrible insides

World seeker so good looking
Like the way everything flows
Physics engine in the game is amazing
Actually experiencing how the sunny looks like and doing parkwar all over it and the characters all to scale is so cool
Jinbei Robin better
Y'all speed readers on God
Oh did he release marineford?
Let me work out then I'll watch it over lunch
Robin and Jinbei are literally both mature intelligent adults and have better chemisty
Headcanon
😎 got em
He's blue boy
Green no good
Also french dumb
😎
LMAO
Bruh
Yeah the english translation is much better
I wouldnt say plane more like just minimum
Law goes "It's kaido"
When I'm the english I'm sure he says something cooler
But with a different fruit <:WBeardWhat:638862189771620372>
My story for my one piece dnd campaign epic
omg
I've made a discovery with the Eye theory
Ok so some of you compare Mihawks, Imu sama, and Zuneshas eyes because they're all like orangish and have an iris unlike most other eyes of males
I've found an official Image that basically references this eye and ties it to Roger and the One Piece
one sec
I dont have a still image of it it's in a video so i gotta screenshot it on my phone and send it 1 sec
Yes those same eyes
tying it to the pirate treasure

It's not exactly the same but this is from legit like 15 years ago
so Idk pretty similar
wekk
well
It's from the Pirate Rap.
The best song in one piece history
LMAO
Yes it's Rogers eyes but also the eyes of the pirate who seeks the One piece
not just Roger
Tying it to the voices of all things maybe
Are they?
Yellow and Irises
and also Rogers
These aren't just random eyes
these are Rogers and the eyes of anyone seeking the great pirate treasure
I don't even care about the eye theory tbh
but
any way for the pirate rap to come into play in a relevant way is amazing.
Tell me those Eyes don't look like Imus
Someone send Imus eyes
Why can't you just appreciate the pirate rap
When am I gonna find a girl that likes one piece 😔 like how u gonna like volleyball anime and my hero and not one piece
What crew mates touched each other?
Instant love
Bruh
Just had someone on instagram tell me because Mihawk didn't kill buggy that means haki doesn't affect DF users 😔
Sanji boy
Plot twist Im sama is actually a good person
Fuck us for assuming the worst
He stabbed luffys bounty poster because he's bad that a good guy like him has a bounty
Proof? How do we know they've destroyed anything
Yeah Oda has used pronouns that can work for either gender
Dam the Duval VA has Covid
Sad time
Why did WB join rox in the first place
We saw even when he was super young all he wanted was still a family
Family doesn't sound like Rox crew they
Nah that was Roger
Rocks had da baddies
Roger ain't got no babes
It took him so long to get Rouge
LMAO
Izo
Lmao
What'd I miss
Did the mods go on a perge?
The will of D the natural enemy to Discord mods
I agree
👀
If only everyone in <#164971940648321024> joined my one piece DnD 😔
I'm excited to watch it
Nah luffy doesn't think like that
As far as luffy is concerned he killed his brother that's it
