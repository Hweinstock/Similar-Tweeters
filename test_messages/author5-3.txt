What do you need goose
Like in what way
The roger message or the poneglyph it self
Ulti was introduced after ace so ulti > ace
> New chapter out yet? <@!107217661628301312>  30 min
Catarina’s fruit might have a handicap just like bonclay
Ofc nami thumbnail
You ate the bait tanu
Zoro vs kamazo was dope
Urashima vs luffy was bs but other than that it’s been great imo
> i wish one piece kai is just one piece but its done in classic style <@!198930928083402753>  and 4:3 aspect ratio  <:MomoCreep:624652617431253033>

Oof ussop
Official is out guys
Why do they split them
Thx doom
Queen is goat
Break week officially started
<:Crydo:586275183032270849>
Lmao
Where do you find this shit Jaguar
Damn
Luffy Kidd and law fighting in the new op is sooo good
Bro you want me to remember ending 1
It’s been years
The one with the crew standing by the sea
On sunset
loli a that a real thumbnail
Hey doom how many hours a day do you spend here
He’s a mod right
Do they get paid for this lol
Do they have a life
But I’m asking for real
I’m just curious
You got it boss
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
So should I ask less questions or just be here less
I’m sorry if I seem like a shit poster I’m still new here and figuring stuff out
I’m not intentionally doing it
I don’t care about the  ban or warning. I love this place so I don’t wanna ruin the experience for others
I still believe that kaido is tough due to haki
Just like bm
Why is bm so tough ? Did we get an explanation
Genetics of whom ? Her parents were normal
> <@!564773067969265674> How different is it reading the official or scanned translation vs original japanese <@703504844903940096>  reading the Japanese is the best experience you’ll get bc of all of the nuances Japanese has so you’ll enjoy all the jokes puns and specific meanings. Fan translations are diff, batoto tries to be “professional” so they do it like the official whereas I try to keep the raw Japanese experience like oda writes it without westernizing the story by paraphrasing and such but all fan translations will have mistakes unless corrected later. The official has the best translation but it makes the story lose a lot of the nuances and sometimes change the order of speech bubbles or even entire sentences. So it’s better to read all the fan translations and the official too unless you wanna learn Japanese to have the best experience but that’ll take you years to appreciate and understand everything
There’s no absolute win here tbh
> I would love to do that if I ever get the time <@703504844903940096>  even tho I understand Japanese I still spend 4-7 to check every word in a dictionary sine some words can have 15-100 meanings so I try to come up with the best translation possible which is still tough so I leave notes explaining stuff about the Japanese wording at the end
It’s beautiful tho I love it
It’s all for the fandom man so if anyone has any feedback I’ll appreciate it. Also please tolerate my mistakes since I’m not a native Japanese speaker
Thx for the appreciation though
Who do you guys think will die in wano other than scabbards
Who cares about fodder
How would they capture him tho
Did a month pass since the full moon in wci ? Could the op world have multiple moons
I think it’s only been like 2 weeks
Yeah that panel
We don’t see everything in op
What could those things around the planet be ? Other planets
They’re most likely moons
Enel didn’t say he was going to the moon
He just wanted to go up
Enel just ended up in the moon
Was there vearth in the moon ? Isn’t it just rocks
I trust the Ohara people
Oda also made sure to show the figure
Could those multiple moons have to do with ancient history since that what they studied at ohara
Could be
They say full moon because in Japanese there no plural so it’s up for debate
Could the moons have been destroyed in the void century
Yeah we could only see one moon at time too
It’s all possible
Yeah but the moons might have a cycle where only one is visible at a time
Multiple moons might have to do with the calm belt
Since gravity and a
Like maybe the gravity of one moon affecting the waves could be canceled by the other moons so we get the calm belt
> What if there are two sanjis <@!206896898215378945>  asking the real questions
If multiple moons is the norm then they won’t talk about it
I get it but it would be interesting
Uruanus could’ve been used to destroy the moons in the void century so now there’s one only
Yeah it’s been 800 years so geography could’ve changed
Watch the egg being a troll
Fleeb the theorist
Do we know why there’s no currents in the calm belt and why seakings lie there mostly
Germa can clone people ffs so technology exists for sure but it has to be different based on the island or the sea
They’re too small to be planets
Their model has to be significant otherwise why would oda show it
Enel went to the moon and oda showed us a model by some of the smartest and dedicated people so it has to be relevant
The evidence does both ways here
Op world is mostly like ours but oda can come out and say the moon cycle is a month and half or something so we can’t say for sure since there’s no concrete way
What was that hole anyways
Or they just lied
Hello
I doubt all scabbards will die
Some surly will
One heat breath and they’re gone
Kin cuts fire but kaido obliterates mountains
Would be cool to see ngl
I lit jumped when Marco showed up
Luffy is serious now
It’s scary
I’m curious as to how much luffy will do here
I think kin smiled bc he’s happy that they’re finally gonna achieve their goal and it’s thanks to luffy I doubt it has to do with confidence
Wano has been great
Years of waiting for wano and it’s finally here
She will mostly fight peros
> as said, it's unlikely they could ever take him down eitehr, but they know that <@160778857702490113>  do they really know
They are going into the fight with their all they must think they have a chance
Actually nvm my brain stopped there kin’s speech last chapter is enough proof
Yeah
I feel like kiku is gonna die and it saddens me
Can’t wait for sulong bepo
Bepo will one shot kaido
He’s the best
Bepo was being bullied by satchi and penguin before law found him lama
Bounce his ass to space
Enel is amino on steroids
Rayleigh is too old rn
Isn’t his a mythical tho
Aren’t human fruits mythical tho just like sengoku
Why does shonen always go crazy with the hair
There should a limit tho
It’s like a scale of power
> I swear to God Mip if you say "you can't have characters that are too strong" you're going to set me off <@!289876647354826752>  what did I do. I just find it weird that hair is agreed upon as a way to show power. I never said it wasn’t cool
You know what I mean bro
Jokes on you I’m already dead
I mean dbz and now sulong so...
Why do I even talk. I should shut up
That’s the point
How did the toilet discussion start
Stoopid says 3
I hate that
Nice pfp <@!300398217001173002> flapjack was my childhood
Does feanky have a neck
This chat is more dead than ace
I think he means real life time
The one piece is most likely just info and gr treasure
Roger left his treasure  there
The op itself is probably the last poneglyph
The last info not road poneglyph

I have info about the void century I think
That’s a good question
But he can still take down buildings
Stoopid you’re amazing
Law is broken
When was that implied
If brook left his body then bb touched him would he down
Bb should
The fruit has to be tied to the user so brook’s soul is connected to the fruit which is active
The problem with brook is that he’s a skeleton
How do you kill what’s already dead
Brook should float tho
He can walk on water
I don’t think the water makes them sink
It’s their weight
How does brook drown if he’s dead
He doesn’t need food or oxygen
Does breaking his bones kill him
Brook is immortal dude
> <@!419608704418054157> And laughed while destroying countless families around the world <@!415999229564157955>  you win some you lose some
We need more buggy ball
Isn’t there haki shigan too
When bb uses black hole are the things he swallows held inside of him ?
Is it infinite space ? Can logia users generate infinite substance of their fruit
Why can’t someone like akainu hold stuff inside of him if caribu can
Caribu is just dirt and water tho. I understand how bb works since it’s darkness and black holes but how does caribu work
Yeah I know
But caribu isn’t a black hole
Can’t a pool of lava have things inside
Lmao
He can tech harden some lava and hold stuff inside
Yeah it’s just properties of the fruit
I just get hung up on technicalities
It’s actually quite op to be able to produce an infinite amount of a certain substance
Btw is kata mochi or can he just produce it
Kiku was not
But he’s a paramicia
Yeah but I’m still confused as to how that works
So he has all logia properties
If you can turn into a plant it’s probably a zoan but if you can sprout plants like in film z then it’s a paramicia. Imo
Paramicia don’t include living creatures. As in turning into one
In film z the girl sprouts plants
Could be special zoan
I mean if someone can become a plant like a fly trap or smth. That can’t be paramicia since your turning into another creature
Yeah special zoan makes sense to me
That’s a paramicia imo
You can’t become dirt can you
Yeah why not
But if it’s a logia and sprouts plants that’d be too much even tho it’s kinda useless
Like too many abilities for one fruit.  But the. There’s sugar so it’s probably fine
Is the crow revolutionary guy a paramicia
That just makes things worse lol
If he can turn into crows it’s should be zoan but since it’s multiple it’s a paramicia
It’s either zoan or paramicia
I bet it’s paramicia
Crow logia wtf
Maybe it’s not crows but he chooses to make crows out of his logia substance
It has to be smth light since they can fly
> <@!564773067969265674> Hmmmmmm... plasticine logia. But has he has all the colours, it is always black bc they are all mixed <@!415999229564157955>  tf is plasticine
Flexing medical knowledge
Still don’t know what that is lmao but I doubt oda will go there
I never had playdough only generic shit
Who falls for those titles anyway
Hey there
Can tamago die
Amazon has then yeah
Check bookstores near you too
You can find people selling on eBay for much cheaper
> <@564773067969265674>  That would be nice <@742532068608704532>  I’ve seen collections of 50 volumes up for like 20-50$
You can support oda by buying merch
> Damn, I wonder what you'd find inside those to be so cheap <@!415999229564157955>  it’s mostly volumes not in order and people don’t buy used volumes for the price of the new so it’s dirt cheap. So you’ll get some from alabasta and all of wano for example
Hyogoro basically confirmed that zoro used ryuou in alabasta in chapter 939
It coulda been haki. True
Glr had a color spread analysis this chapter lol
It was amazing
Bc he appreciates art
Would probably revert to a human
<:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
Can you hit me there
Damn you got me there
Some high standards here
He dodged the jelly bean jut like you dodge facts strong
!lanji2
Tits kill sanji get your facts straight
Can’t see shit bro
Who tf has unsymmetrical eyebrows
4kids made crocodile say desert doodoo ffs
<:TamaHuh:735289165109002260>
I still enjoyed it tho
Anime
People sleep on thriller bark too much
You didn’t like Kuma
English is easy bro
About what
A speech about sports ?
How many hours away is that
In your time
It’s 4 am for me rn
If I’m awake then I’ll help you
Bye
Cringe is his brand
Tekking is like your friend who you talk about op with
Berry yeah
Someone sent tekking a cinder block in the mail
Some people dropped videos before the French scans even
Isn’t Ohara reviewing the Japanese rn
He’s pretty good iirc
I’ve been loving mr morj lately
Bda is good too
Glr is really good
Yeah but it’s nicer to listen to a vid than read the wiki
What did he say
It’s obviously acting
What’s he on
That’s a big oof
It’s his opinion but it’s a shit opinion ngl
Is franky infertil now
<#513313101337329665>
I think
Robin was always weird tho
Only the <:RobinHUH:665766366481219614> face was surprising tbh
Robin in 984 is totally within her character she’s always dark and gloomy
Nami in wci looked so cool
Robins needs smth similar
Pre ts robin outfits were better IMO
> I prefer short hair Nami back in Sabaody <@319602380041879552>  big facts
Enies lobby nami outfit was weird
Like the design
All that can fight at least
Can stussy use haki with her long range shigan
Yeah
I feel like denjiro has smth up his sleeve
Sup
Wtf gaben
No one cares about bepo smh
I think I’d ulti or black Maria were about to kill one of the sh then sanji surely will fight them
Sanji needs better armament
Invisibility is broken rn
Observation should counter it imo
A yonkou should have no problem with invisibility
If someone has future sight then they can at least see themselves get hit by an invisible attack
Fuji can see everything so observation has some merit
You just need to be faster
Future sight has limits too and someone might be better than others in terms of how long into the future they can see
Endurance probably or who can dodge and attack more
But you need high focus for future sight
In a fast pace battle it’s harder
True
An expert fighter can probably dodge without future sight
It helps tho
I think future sight is overrated a little bit
It won’t protect you from everything
Yeah oda is who decides but there has to be rules an mechanics
Yeah but he can’t just negate previous rules just bc he wants to that’s called an ass pull
Yeah kata was incredibly fast that he dodged some snakeman hits too
If both are future sight masters and have the same speed then it would be up to who cal land more hits
It has stronger armament
It’s not like you can dodge all hits just because you have future sight
You’d still have to rank some
Some techniques could be useful like when luffy hit kata even tho he used future sight bc kata didn’t look far enough into the future
I think it’s all about limits
Like if kizaru is the fastest then no one can dodge him
But he’s on unit infinitely fast
I think it’s safe to say that it’s about the full package not just individual things
You can tell Japanese by hiragana and katakana
Chinese is just kanji
Do you guys think luffy can beat kata just with adv armament
Like a full fledged win
No I mean just with the upgrade of adv armament lmao
Is that enough to say that he’s stronger than kata
Aokiji is experienced so he knows what to do without future sight
Btw why did kata hurt luffy when they first had armament clash ? Was it stronger haki or kata’s fruit
Kaido seems ok o have a soft side to him
He didn’t kill momo bc he wasn’t sure if he’s a kouzuki
Yeah he’s not dumb so he has to finish off the kouzukis but he’s not a total savage to a certain degree
Yeah but he seems to have some morals
I didn’t say he wasn’t evil
True
I really want to know his reason for wanting war
I feel like oden told him smth
Kaido bad as a reason for war  would be stupid ngl
But even real life morals are not that great
Technically bm is good bc she wants no racism but her execution is bad
Luffy wants freedom but he wants all the meat
I mean her goal is good but her ways are what’s wrong
Yeah bc the pk is the most free
He told that to Rayleigh
> Is that why he wants to be the pirate king? <@!297795816255389697>  yeah he told that to Rayleigh in shabondy
> Were the marines bad for wanting to execute ace? <@703504844903940096>  everyone sees themselves as the good side or the lesser evil at least
That’s not how it works spunk
Luffy isn’t your conventional good guy. He’s a pirate and he is selfish bc he only cares about those close to him
When did he share his meat
> bb the main villain is waay better than even some of the early villains like krieg <@703504844903940096>  just bc someone is a loser doesn’t mean he’s a bad character. Kreig and Moria were defeated and straight up bad people but they were still good characters with reasonable motives
Yeah which gives him character
Oh I see but that’s hella subjective
But we still don’t know bb motives or goals
Bb might want to destroy the world
Yeah I can agree with you on that
Luffy is weird bc he is selfish mostly but he still helped vivi and fmi
He doesn’t like to see people’s freedom taken away
Yeah luffy is a better pirate I can agree
Yeah wb helped a lot of people
Bonney Kidd and bb are the realest pirates
Yeah her general attitude
> WB wont care about morals if you hurt his crew member <@703504844903940096>  yeah but that’s reasonable since they attacked his crew first. Wb won’t go out of his way to hurt people
Kidd is actually the most “pirate” bc he likes hurting people krieg only idea it when necessary for him just like bb
Yeah there’s actually no full fledged pirates in op. Like the Tortola package I mean
Bonney seems to care about kuma so that doesn’t make her necessarily nice imo
Iirc real life pirates at least some of them enjoyed killing people even if they surrendered
Yeah I get it but I just mean that they enjoyed killing to the point that some used to bathe in and drink blood
They were savages to a degree
I might need to look into it more. My knowledge could be shaky
It’s not just the stereotype. I remember watching a video or reading somewhere about how cruel they were for the fuck of it  but it could be fake or bad sources
Yeah greedy  leaders were a big thing back then
Yeah they rigged the system to their advantage right ?
Corruption won’t go away as long as greed exists
Nah it’s just oda having fun
People read into color spreads too much
Remember zoro sitting on a greave with a number of an upcoming chapter. People said he will die then
Yeah
That was the dumbest theory I’ve ever heard
One color spread had the kouzuki symbol on the straw hats kimonos. That was cool. It was like hundreds of chapters back
Yeah that one
Soooo cool
It’s just that oda wanted to reach wano so bad but he wanted to show some of it earlier
Ace dying was monumental
Iirc oda always wanted to draw the straw hats in samurai shields but he had to change it to the beast pirates outfit for the plot so he did it before the raid
Luffy had to lean his lesson the hard way
It’s a miracle he survived
Luffy is still reckless even tho he matured
> <@!564773067969265674> - Ace's death didn't affect his personality massively, but increased his motive to focus on what was important at that time: becoming strong enough to protect his friends, which forced him to mature and become a little more wise. <@524603876482220093>  exactly, the point of ace’s death wasn’t for him to change as a person rather learn to evaluate the situation. But he’s still reckless to this day I mean he barged in on two yonkou
Luffy used to live in his own world no he knows to look at reality
Luffy has battle smarts more than life
That kaido poster oof
Bounty standard weee diff back then
He was the 2nd commander so he was hyped
Ace had potential but he was a device
Now we know that commander position means nothing but back then...
Who wrote the novels
I thought it’s only not illustrated by oda
Is the writer from his staff or an outsource
Neither are ded
Unfinished arcs pendas
It would be nice to see orochi dead but it’s anti climactic
I can accept that orochi is dead but kanjuro Isn’t
Maybe
Orochi might be able to sprout a new body
You nerve know
He abused hiyori so he has unfinished business not to mention his story with oden
I like they way kaido “killed” him it was satisfying but he has more to do
The point of kaido not needing him was served so it’s okay if he lives
If orochi lives bc he took precautions it would add to his character actually
Kanjuro had a good backstory
Kaido didn’t need orochi to rule wano or get in
Orochi is a coward but he’s not dumb so he might have known that kaido would do this and made sure he’d survive
> <@!564773067969265674> so you're saying kaido and him planned him faking his death <@738998014039031888>  that could be possible, but I mean that orochi must’ve known that kaido would dispose of him at some point so he made sure to prepare and escape. That would improve his character imo
> <@564773067969265674> would make no sense to me even if he survives what does that mean he has to escape and then what? He is not important anymore <@606196171307745308>  he’s not important to kaido, yes. But he has unfinished business with the kouzukis
Why do people think orochi is dumb ?
Orochi abused hiyori ffs
He’s a big pussy yes but not dumb
> <@564773067969265674> so he dies anyway <@606196171307745308>  I see why being murder fuel is bad but he can’t die now. It’s  Just how I see it
I’m not sure bc hiyori said she doesn’t want to interfere with the battle
But orochi used her as a wax toy for years so smth has to happen
No it’s a break
Enma seems to have to do with aura so if it’s adv haki the zoro probably can hurt him but not kill him
Does enma force ryuou
We see an aura around enma so I think it’s adv haki
Luffy says he’ll follow kin later so he probably will deal with bm for now
Neko and inu seem promising ngl
I just want zoro action whatever it is
> If the enma is forcing its Wilders haki into the sword could it be possible that the opponents haki is also sucked in by touching it? <@606196171307745308>  that’s a good question. It might block their haki where it makes contact
Cursed swords have their own will
Do we know how to curse a sword ?
It’s just that  cursed swords list for blood then
Gaben has been really hilarious today
Is that guy actually named Gandhi lmao
Raizo shoulda poked kaido’s eye
If he’d stuck a bomb down kaido’s throat then could’ve beeb done for lmao
Kiku is dying mark my words. It’s sad tho
I love kiku man
I hope she won’t
Why do people hate raizo lol
Hell yeah doom
Kin is probably dying yes
Does raizo have a df
I always forget otsuru
Oda’s art has been amazing in wano
Who cares About shinobu
Weren’t the onibanshou a small group like 10 lead but fuko ? When did they become 5000
He has long earlobes too right
Toko crying over yasu broke me
Can’t coc have to do with how tough bm and kaido are
Flying like floating or flapping wings
He has a division so he already has responsibilities
> Nice monet pfp shes underrated <@564773067969265674> <@!220515768897372160>  finaaaaaaaly someone gets it
I can see what you mean Alex but it won’t make him stronger rather even more mature or smth
Marco has no desire to be a captain
He wants to protect what wb had
He’s so loyal
Ace had personality and potential
Also the connection and interaction  with luffy made people like him
True he shoulda ignored magma boo
Ace was a device and nothing more
> Well when some asshole just killed your friends and family in front of you then calls your Dad a coward I doubt anyone would walk away <@683663101186277416>  I would
He’s lovable for his personality but he did nothing
Ace was hella funny ngl
What did ace achieve ? As a character
> <@564773067969265674>  > He was known enough to be a warlord <@521783526878609418>  yeah but I mean what did he do within the time we see him ?
> Define an achievement as a character <@!114296407816404992>  what did I ace do that makes him a good character
He appears then gets captured and dies a stupid death
I like him a lot don’t get me wrong but he has no substance other than his connection and interactions with luffy
> Did you miss the entire blackbeard vs ace plotline?<@564773067969265674> <@683663101186277416>  where he got his ass handed to him
Look I’m not hating on ace I love his chateau it other than that he didn’t do much for me
The only substance I see in him is his funny and chill personality
He’s cool too
> <@564773067969265674> I want you to know the way you feel about Ace is the way I feel about Carrot <@521783526878609418>  how do you feel about her <:TamaThink:741812943913746473>
> His last line to luffy, "thank you for loving me," wasnt just a line. It showed how unworthy ace felt to be loved, to the extent that he thought he needed to thank HIS OWN LITTLE BROTHER for caring about him <@!131218004540129280>  actually I take it back this was good enough
People hate carrot not for her personality but those who love her love her too much
<@!415999229564157955> yeah I always forget about his childhood for some reason. I take back what I said, he’s actually cool. I never disliked him anyway, but I just wanted to see more of him
Wasn’t Marco too young
The crew could’ve been smaller then so less commanders
Was oden actually given a commander position? Didn’t wb consider him his brother so like 1st mate
Coded we all know what we mean chill
Damnit vegito
Whiteybay wasn’t in mf?
Did whitey bay in the payback war
Lmao
> <@!564773067969265674> why did you change your pfp from best girl to this , what a downgrade <:aFeelsAceMan:586371608382537759> <@328936254978916352> i like that you like Yamato but I’ve been feeling money lately
Yeah that Yamato panel was dope
Dora you’re a devil
Kanmui no
Chapter 950 lol
Why does also manga exist
Too crowded ? It feels like there’s only 30 people here lmao
No I don’t come here on chapter day
> took 2 enraged punches from the ' strongest man in the world ' and finished the day without any serious damage , who else can claim that ? <@328936254978916352>  that was bs he shoulda died in mf
You lose either way coded
Does the zoro sanji debate happen daily lmao
Damn stoopid with the sources
Oda doesn’t draw all scars for ease
I think he stated it in an sbs
It will
I doubt toki is dead
I still feel weird about the toki hiyori situation
I don’t feel safe here lmao
But seriously I’m not sure how to feel about konurasaki is hiyori. I still don’t believe it
What Can’t I have opinions
The scar will be relevant
She just gave in too quick and told zoro everything
It’s weird
Still why did she tell a stranger
Please kamui
She ha some big info about zoro trust me
Fair
Who made those commands lmao
Damn okama
Ironic

Hey <@319602380041879552> what’s the anime in your pfp
Is it any good
Bm crew seems better than kaido. Her crew is more held together
Bm is her own worst enemy
But bm crew care about each other unlike kaido’s
They respect kata too
Mega assholes yeah
But sasaki and who’s who seem to not give a shit
The core of bm is all brothers and sisters while kaido’s is former defeated pirates so it’s more fragile
The mostly fear kaido except ulti who loves him lol
> doffy and viola had a sexual relationship? <@509083474955599874>  is said that deessrosa sure is a passionate town when he was asked about that
They had some tension
Especially before luffy fought doffy for the 2nd time
Doffy is a chad
Yes kilua but people asked and oda answered
To piss off robin fans
Alex is edgy
Zoro x hiyori is where it’s at
Chill Alex its a joke
Zoro x smoker in Tashigi’s body <:SanjiSmart:682225575041302618>
Chopper x brook
<:SaboEvil:705903442995970058>
Poor law
97 is still a month away so it’s still some time for the cover
Too sad they abandoned the samurai outfits
Didn’t robin find the poneglyph room
Is the last road poneglyph lost
I ordered 95 and 96 can’t wait to get it
Where does box set 3 end
> :GWnatesnowSad: <@272064319661801473>  volumes in Japan cost 440 yen so 4$ or less
> <@!564773067969265674> i'm not buying loose copies like some plebe <@272064319661801473>  it’s the official from shueisha
Can bm make homies from islands tho
Black Maria is fine
Black Maria unites this server damn
Let him I’m liking it
That’s not better kamui
Jack is underrated
Fuck decken
Is that the past or present ? It’s amazing
Oda has something with camels
Here, eyelashes and aikiji’s penguin is named camel
Wasn’t that ace

All three did
Shit I’m late
Why did bb attack the revolutionaries anyway
> do you remember a chapter? <@!372464153480134666>  brook vs oven was 864 I think
I still can’t tell if the daily sanji vs zoro arguments are jokes or serious lmao
Btw the sound of it it seems like I shouldn’t
How did we get here <:TamaHuh:735289165109002260>
Thx slim
It’s not a guarantee that we’ll get and explanation, could just be like “zoro has asura”
Cursed blades lust for blood iirc
Doom the wiki says that zoro said kitetsu is bloodthirsty and wanted to make slashes without his direction describing it as a problem child. Idk the chapter unfortunately
Hitetsu has nidia now
That’s pretty sick ngl
Why should Yamato use a sword
It’s cool that Yamato has parts in her personality from both oden and kaido
I know but she’s like their love child lol
Maybe kaido didn’t allow her to learn to use a sword
^
Gotta dance naked for five years too
Kaido destroyed the roof yeah
You mean when they were in roger’s execution
^
Was it yesterday
It’s such a good podcast
The title is always wrong lmao
Does nitro just let you post gifs
It’s a good way to support discord but it feels like a scam to me lol
But then Agian I’m cheap af
That’s nitro classic right, what’s the 10$ thing then
That pun hurts me deeply
<:WBDisgust:650047749831524372>
Spoilers should come out in 7-8 days so it’s not that bad
Monet is best girl fight me
You’re too simple minded pound smh
Did you watch any of the anime perona
Perona is hilarious
I actually don’t mind spoilers too especially with a series like op since there’s way more thank just the big reveals. I still prefer not be spoiled but it’s not a big deal
The fact that he didn’t kill sasaki tells me that he likes or at least doesn’t blame him and his beef is with kaido and orochi only
Luffy will eat kaido’s shadow
^
Hawkins power seems like an ass pull to me
If it’s smth like gon from HxH I’d be fine with it
If the Hawkins power up works like ivankov’s hormones and has a consequence I’d be fine
If there’s no consequences then it’s just fairytale at this point lmao
It would be too convenient for Hawkins to draw a good card for luffy to use vs kaido imo
I’d like to see Moria redeem himself in wano
Best place to live
<:TamaHuh:735289165109002260>
No plz
^
Speaking of headcanon
I have a crackpot theory
What if denjiro looks back at all the pain he lived through for 20 years while kin traveled through time and didn’t have to deal with that pain. So he sees him self as the rightful heir to the shogun position. That’s why he didn’t kill sasaki since he’s allied with him and maybe who’s who too since they want to take higher positions. That will also give a diff side to him saying “kin is so smart” so it’s condescending and not blind trust. I believe this since it was too obvious that kyoshiro is denjiro and the twist is yet to come
I’m too big brain I know
I warned you that it’s headcanon
I just find that kyoshiro is denjiro and komurasaki is hiyori too obvious
I neeeed more twists
Bro it’s a crackpot theory chili plz
> its too obvious because we talk about one piece every time , i am sure a binge reader would be blown by the last few chapters of oden flashback <@328936254978916352>  yeah that’s true
Lmao
Is there a time limit for sulong
So if neko and inu use sulong with haki they won’t last that long damn
I doubt neko and inu will stop even if it kills them
They have a fighting chance but not an edge over kaido no way
Didn’t oden give his journal to toki
It should be in good condition
I think oden or doffy told kaido smth about the d that’s why he’s scared and wants war
Kaido seems to fear oden and the ptsd last chapter is weird
Yeah it’s all speculation
> And what about learning about the D would make him want war? <@698761447835959337>  you know all the stuff about fate and joyboy and how the world is changing so he might want war to prevent whatever is coming
Kaido is bored or kaido is bad isn’t really a good or convincing reason for war
Unicorn tree duo is the best
I don’t remember anything from zou lmao
> <@!564773067969265674> You don't remember Carrot no diffing Zoro? <@!415999229564157955>  how could I forget. Have faith in me stoopid
What chapter does act 2 start at
Does anyone know where I can read op in Japanese online
Pre ts anime was the shit
> you mean the slideshow? <@272064319661801473>  the 4:3 aspect ratio mah dude
Oof
^
Every arc in op has its charm
Is it bad that I like kurro
Jango was hilarious
Nami throwing zoro over  the oil was funny
Toko broke my heart crying over yasu
Who’s rika
Oh yeah she was amazing too
We got to see zoro acting all compassionate eating her onigiri lmao
They were modeled after fruit just like momo
<:Crydo:586275183032270849>
Stoopid is amazing damn
How do you know all this shit
Stoopid knows batchi which is all that matters
Really
<:QueenKEKW:702706011298988045>
Kuro had haki in his fingers
Zoro okama confirmed
Don’t we all
Would koby even know her at this point
How ? Even her voice is diff
Can swords cut alvida or does her fruit protect her
Stoopid do you write fan fics in your free time lmao
It pays well I hate
Kiku can be whatever she wants
You’d have to go through me fist stoopid
> <@!564773067969265674> Don't u see my name, young one? <@!415999229564157955>  boasting your status is an act of weakness and insecurity
Doesn’t matter beat
Inu is like half as tall as kiku
Why are the scabbards so huge
Imagine using feet instead of meters
How many ounces are in a gallon zeph
<:ShanksHmmm:586437070742880257>
The imperial system isn’t even a system lmao
No it’s just a collection of diff measurement units. Look it up
Who even makes a unit of 12 zeph wtf
People from wano seem to be huge Henry
Is judge fat or muscle
Faire enough
<:TamaWot:723047449043927073>
How do you know zeph <:TamaThink:741812943913746473>
Maybe too cultured even
I just took the term to mean red neck
Nah ryuou last episode was well done imo
Raizo played udon like a violin
> The only person can take that sword from him is kuina <@680153434238091317>  it’s just a color spread it has nothing to do with the story
Raizo shoulda poked kaido’s eye smh
> <@285327673553846272> luffy carrying sabo stick is not just an art <@680153434238091317>  luffy sabo and ace all used pipes when they were kids
People give pudding a lot of shit. She was good tho
> <@564773067969265674> I gonna roast you guys so bad when sabo appears in wano <@680153434238091317>  even if he appears the color spread has nothing to do with it
> <@564773067969265674> isn't that the chapter cover? <@680153434238091317>  it’s just art !! It has nothing to do with the story unlike cover stories
Kiku stabbed kaido’s hand she’s dope bro
Tf coded
Training with enma are zoro lean to control his haki so it’s kind of a power up
Pica level Jesus
Hitwtsu told zoro that he’s gotten better at using enma so he trained with it
How long does it take a blade to become black
Do we know
Yeah Mihawk wants to chill
Kyros song was adorable
Would anyone be mad if zoro killed kaido tho
I’ll be happy with any zoro action
Zoro hasn’t had a good fight since dressrosa
^
> <@564773067969265674> i would say kamazou(killer) was more hard then pica <@606196171307745308>  pica was just bs. Kamazo was way cooler but I want zoro to go all out it’s been years dude
The most I can see zoro doing is cutting kaido or smth but no way he kills him
> <@564773067969265674> what fight do u ment in dressrosa ? <@606196171307745308>  i was taking about pica bc zoro had to use 3000 worlds thing  which is the most he did until now. I’m not sure if rengouku onigiri is stronger but I want to see more of zoro in wano
I wanna see blood in wano man
Mooore blood
I’m just hungry
Why does law want to beat kaido ? Did we know the goal of his plan
Idc who fights kaido as long as it’s a coordinated strategic fight and not just spamming strongest  attacks
^
Ussop heading straight for the numbers is hard
Why did Magellan say he’d protect doffy
That’s what I remember
Didn’t Magellan say he won’t allow the wg to interfere with his prisoners ? Or was that before he was demoted
Yeah but he has no power or authority now
Is he confirmed as a diff species
Yeah exactly that’s why I’m confused as to why the wg didn’t kill him already
Why risk the chance of him escaping
Why keep a loose end tho
Just kill him and that’s it
If kaido wanted to get doffy back he can probably break in and take him right
Yeah but there has to be reason not to kill doffy. Otherwise a yonkou can break in and free him for whatever purpose
Doffy was speculating
The wg seems to need doffy for smth
> <@564773067969265674>  why do you say that <@!206896898215378945>  bc they’ve kept him alive all this time when he’s a major threat
If I was the wg I’d kill doffy immediately and not risk it unless I need him later. It just how I see it
Didn’t bb make level 6 prisoners fight each other to join his crew ? So there shouldn’t be anyone other than doffy down there
Why wouldn’t they want to join bb and be free
Do fleet admirals know stuff about the void century or does the wg keep them after retirement for marine related knowledge
Yeah it’s probably bc they know of god valley and such stuff
I doubt the wg will tell marines anything about the void century even the fleet admirals
Akainu got the job at the worst possible time lmao
Akainu has a lot of hair to deal with rn
Marines seem to want to make moves
The warlords are gone so the wg wants the yonkou gone too apparently
Is it confirmed that ssg has to do with wapometal
Smiles are useless imo
Smile cyborgs would be funny more than anything
But it’s a risk. Look at sanji and reiju
Having some capacity for thinking would be better than just robot go kill brrrr
^
Hey bean what do you think is better, sanji bs page1 in the manga or anime and why
I meant vs lmao
The anime is weird sometimes look at luffy vs doffy for example
Boruto is all anime canon lmao
The manga is decent
Isn’t that all of us
