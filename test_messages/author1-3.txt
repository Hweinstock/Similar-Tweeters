The ultimate clickbait
"Sulong minks are taken down by KAIDO & One Piece is revealed?! Chap 988 discussion" <@!274366418223497217>
I hate that about youtubers, strong
We used to have a user who thought it was okay for it to happen
But like, I hate it when youtubers post spoilers in their titles
Ugghhhh I hate youtubers tho
Except like King of Lightning
Only because it's funny when his eyes bulge
jfc
We've gotta stop mentioning honor tho
There really isn't much in this series to speak of <:LUL:321931602655707136>
It's kind of a uniquely Wano dedicated concept, even
And they don't even mention it much
Ace's death was big for Luffy, Whitebeard's death was the biggest event in One Piece so far
If Ace had just been executed, nothing about the world would've changed really
Whitebeard was acknowledged as the end of an era
He didn't really mature much from it <:LUL:321931602655707136> Still goes into the time skip face first to any fight he can
^
He definitely grew in his resolve, that was the  building point of Ace's death
Becoming unshakeable as a pirate
Yeah nah, one thing I used to mention a lot
If you took Luffy out of Marineford, nothing ultimately changes in the situation
I think that impacted him more than anything
It's not just that he was weak, he was almost irrelevant completely
Luffy was barely running at that point, Akainu would've just come down on them
The crew does sometimes
But they still back him up without question, lol
At this point it's almost a gag, no Luffy don't go and spit in an Emperor's cereal pls
Yeh fats, that's one thing I don't like when I read about someone's take on Luffy post-skip
There's usually something about maturity in connection to Ace's death, and with the intent that maybe Luffy wised up a little
Instead of just planting his feet and becoming more of what he already was
Fortsy, Luffy really doesn't get wiser, just stronger as a person
But that was probably Oda's point, since that *is* Luffy
He'll never stop being reckless
Luffy's character arc isn't growing into Rayleigh
He'll never be a super mature, solidly set person, he's always the wear his heart on his sleeve guy
He's got plenty of emotional intelligence yeh, that's one of if not his best trait
Like, right up there with his sheer willpower
But I feel like people expect him to pull a full on MC brilliance growth or something
Doom, i'd say his changes are more toward what you said before
Exactly archer
He's not the one who's supposed to grow into a late stage life mentality
Yeh fats, I agree with that
Luffy's probably never going to change, and just become better in what he has as a pirate
Didn't Apoo or someone else get to that island as well?
Or was it Urouge who saw it?
And Apoo got the warthogs lol
The weirdest part of that silhouette is the hair
Big Mom looks closer to her silhouette than not
lol
Yeh doom, they took heavy liberties
His afro, ugh

Of course it did <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Pendas, was it made by Oda?
That wasn't anime only doom
It was just kind of a throw away
No pendas, it's actually got mistakes that contradict the series
It is not canon at all lol
It's just a nice story, and Oda's actually gone and called it alternate universe himself basically
I'm on a call, i'll grab it in a bit
Kanjuro doesn't have much behind him tbh
I'm fine with him being off screened specifically because it was by a scabbard
So they still get some of their revenge, but ultimately, it really was all about Kaido
To the point where another Emperor is hardly even part of the conversation for them, really
People have problems with Orochi because of Kaido, though
As much as he was the reason for things happening, it was entirely Kaido's hand that did it
Orochi was ultimately just another slave to Kaido who thought he was bigger than he was
And didn't even notice it
If he's alive, I'm sure we'll get some good scenes of people expressing it
but it's Kaido who ruined the country and enslaved everyone, Orochi just opened the door for him
<@!289876647354826752> Take it to <#738580480437387264> pls, there's a discussion going on rn
No, the Kozukis have unfinished business with Kaido more than they ever did Orochi
Even Shinobu acknowledges it
And I wanna say Kinemon's mentioned it too, but Kaido's been the big word since the start of the arc
Orochi is far from dumb
He's just pitiful
^
And even then, he's been playing things really, really well
If not for Big Mom coming around and Kaido deciding to expand his empire, he'd still be the winner
he'd be perfectly set
I see him duking it out with Big Mom more than anything
Yep
100million is high
It's high enough for an admiral to get sent after you
It's not about strength if they're not doing anything lol
They've been fighting for 100 years
why would their bounty be higher?
He couldn't control homies, he could only blow them away with the power of his soul
But, we don't know enough about the fruit to say that what he can do with it now is particularly special, or just basic powers he'd never thought to explore in his time
<@!548600820304969772> No, I don't believe so
Define an achievement as a character
Before you ask that question
It's fanart
Everything?
What *didn't* he do that would have?
You can answer that question with his entire tenure in the manga
And it's valid lol
> I like him a lot don’t get me wrong but he has no substance other than his connection and interactions with luffy <@!564773067969265674> That's actually objectively incorrect
And all of Marineford proves it lol
Ace had a whole arc where over 100,000 people, *well* over, were fighting either for him or because of him
It's okay that he didn't do much for you, but to say he had substance is soooo wrong lol
Chopper?
Luffy?
I disliked Ace because his death was a little too out of nowhere for me
As far as his motivations for it goes, that is
But that's more disliking the way Oda ordered his character development
Carrot, I have literally no opinion on at all
I feel like Carrot hate is almost completely just the fan division in her joining the crew or not
People love Big Mom here
We just get the odd power leveler who thinks she's weaker than the other Emperors and that makes her a bad character
Or because she isn't stronger than everyone, it makes her a bad character
lmao
What do people mean by substance?
From a writing perspective, there are an extremely small number of named characters without substance in this series
And mostly it's just because of a lack of spotlight and not because they're flat
lmao
Like, let's define it first
And then pick and choose who has it and who doesn't
Is someone substantial if they meet your good opinion?
Ace fits all of that to the letter lmao
Hm?
Why Katakuri?
^
That's fair
But, Oda just got to go into a lot more depth post-skip with his villains than pre
We don't get too many backstories for antagonists pre-skip for example
Whereas post-skip we're given more motivations and crewbuilding with them
Which is a nice change
Katakuri's writing is nothing too special tbh
The best part about him is that his character was affected by Luffy
Even after the donut scene, the best part about him is that Luffy affects him enough to affect the end of the match
Being perfect and then later being found out to not be perfect is...eh
It's cool, and it's nice that we got a bit more information about his relationships and how that came about for sure
But most of why people like Katakuri is his moveset over his character lol
Like, a cool character is not a substantial one
She's most definitely a villain
She just has an affliction
But anyone denying that is denying the fact that she is probably the singularly most successful Emperor out there
<@!276525516302057486> I don't do youtubers lol
Mark is the only one I like, but not because he's a one piece youtuber, I just like him
Big Mom has been the most terrifying Emperor to date
I have no idea wtf anyone's talking about if they say otherwise lmao
Buildup, sure
Well, not really
Big Mom's still been built up as far more terrifying
Kaido's just been built up as a beast
Big Mom's an actual horrific force of nature
But hang on, work call, I'll @ you with more
That's exactly what Brook is doing with the yomi yomi. All of his powers are just his soul leaving his body in some way, the only outlier is the ice
Even blowing away the homies was just flexing his soul out
The only thing he demonstrated that wasn't directly connected to the fact that he can move his soul freely is summoning ice from the underworld
Everything else is basically just he discovered his fruit allows him to control his soul, not just resurrect
Yeh, but his ignorance doesn't mean he discovered an awakening
Which is a bit of his foolishness, since the very first thing his fruit does do is allow him to control his soul, and he just never tries again
Oh, yeh, but that's not true though
lol
And even if we discount Luffy, Chopper's done *far* more with his fruit than literally everyone in this series who isn't Caesar
Let alone just on the Strawhats, lol
Caesar's the runner up there since he chemically altered himself, but it's not like he got more than gas powers still
It wasn't just doping, he directly altered his fruit's power
He actually *changed* his power
<@!683663101186277416> Alright, about Big Mom vs Kaido
So, Kaido's had a reputation built up for sure
He's been made out to be this invulnerable monster who's barely human, but at the same time, by sheer portrayal he's just been another powerful opponent
He hasn't been particularly scary, he's just strong
And that's inherently nerve wracking, but it's not overly terrifying beyond just you don't want to get hit by the guy
Kaido's crew has honestly been scarier than he ever has, so far anyway
Being able to cause massive destruction and not minding can be scary, but Big Mom can and does the exact same thing, so it can't put him over her
But Big Mom also far more frequently goes into uncontrolled rampages and wrecks even her own home
She's the only Emperor we've got that's been almost completely fleshed out, and she's almost a complete psychopath
That, and Kaido's been resisted before
Big Mom was just about completely unstoppable at WCI
She was this massive, hulking force of nature that could go so far as to make the damn near the island itself collapse on your crew if she wanted
When she showed up causing a tidal wave that almost sunk the Sunny, that was a lot scarier than anything Kaido's shown so far. I say that because we actually get the crew reacting to it, the sheer hopelessness of everything Big Mom threw at them was made so painfully apparent in WCI, versus Kaido basically just giving everyone a free pass if they're strong
It wasn't even only Kaido, Orochi also shared some of what made Wano a pit of anxiety
<@!439543733957165058> Thanks for @ing someone for it, but prefer if you don't tag all of the modsquad. 👍🏾
<@!456583330738208779> You need to use the proper posting format 100% of the time here
That was a big spoiler for that arc
!modlogs 456583330738208779
!whois 456583330738208779
Oh hey, he's gone
More than there are in the series lol
Big Mom's very first portrayal
Was about how she sent someone to destroy a country for her
Her very *next* portrayal was about how she razed several countries to the ground just to make a birthday cake
Kaido's reputation is as a warmongering brute, and that's bad, but Big Mom's portrayed as a gluttonous force of nature
No, Kaido's crew is reputed to do it
Big Mom actually showed it
Only Zou, and only because of a weapon developed by Caesar
Big Mom does it just through her crew's own capabilities, and when she moves, she can even turn everything around you against you
No, I'm saying his reputation has been that way
That's the other thing, Kaido's actually been portrayed as semi-reasonable and not that bad of a guy
Y'know, relative to how people talk about him
He hasn't really been this bloodthirsty, conflict hungry demon that people like to report him s
He's actually avoided more fights than he's gone into
Yeah exactly, Big Mom isn't very simple, but she's a lot more on the nose with how she is
That's why she wins out against Kaido. Kaido's intimidating, Big Mom is pure horror fuel
As in, Kaido's been this calculating, strategic person who's actually cared about what he gets into and when
To the point where he was stressed and bitching about Big Mom coming because there would be a fight he didn't want
Big Mom is basically Luffy, on the other hand
Full force, straight ahead, nothing will prevent her
And when she gets there, she's getting what she wants
No, she doesn't want war, she wants to crush whatever's in her way
Kaido actually wants conflict, Big Mom just moves and destroys things on a whim
No, warmongering is wanting the conflict for conflict's sake. Big Mom doesn't want conflict, she wants her desires filled and is willing to end every conflict out there by ending the opposing side
Kaido wants his war, Big Mom wants to trample everything and get what she wants
Yeah, there's an actual reason for them losing at Water 7
it wasn't just a random turnaround lol
But it's not that he was clapped by Kaido in one hit so much as his absolute strongest barrage could do nothing to him
Oh no, she actually is strategic. That's the other thing, not only is she the most gluttonous Emperor, she's inarguably the most successful
She's actually established her *own* country
And has a legitimate empire going. She's incredibly strategic, and her a military that moves extremely well
and overshadows pretty  much every other emperor's forces, it seems
So even on top of being this strange, omnipotent juggernaut of vices
She also has an iron clad empire with a terrifying number of soldiers
On top of being able to make literally infinite more if she desired
And that's with three different factors in her crew, at that
*At least* three, actually
That, on top of a perfect information network that reaches all the way to the Blues? Yeah, the terror of her influence was made very clear in WCI as well, and it's a lot greater than Kaido's
It's just Kaido has a lot more destruction with his higher ups, it seems
But Kaido didn't silently take over the country, and he never controlled the entire underworld
Kaido was one client of doflamingo's, he was one of if not the biggest but absolutely not his boss or anything close
And Big Mom actually does control a good bit of the underworld
That was also driven home in WCI, especially when so many pillars of the crime world came to pay deference to her
No, he didn't *silently* take it over
It was very obvious and on the nose, and it was because of Orochi, not even Kaido that it happened
So that's not even something good to attribute to him. It was Orochi and Higurashi who went in and made it so Kaido could run Wano
Big Mom, however, does these things directly and herself, and actually has taken over multiple countries to get in
Kaido needed outside help, Big Mom was already ruling places when he had it
Doflamingo was the biggest player in the underworld, and Big mom was shown to have probably the second most influence
Kaido had Doflamingo under his thumb for exactly one thing, and that was Smiles
We don't, but we know he wasn't very powerful back then as a pirate
It took him years into Wano to get to just 1000 people behind him
Actually, Jack ran out of reinforcements he had so many lol
Queen only devastated Udon, and that's big, but that's just Queen
Nope, he brought multiple
a *lot*
He actually ran out of backup he brought so many and the minks defeated them
Yes, he kept bringing backup
He brought all the ships and then had even more go over lol
Sure, but we actually saw Big Mom doing it
for a LOT less reason, too
That's the big thing, Kaido brought down a country looking for a wanted person who could help bring him down
Big Mom wanted to make a cake.
And brought down *several*
It wasn't sheer numbers, we see single operatives reporting on it being done lol
The first report was only Bobbin coming in saying he did it
And we see Jack needing so many reinforcements he runs out of crew to do it himself
Kaido threw a LOT more numbers at a country so far than Big MOm <:LUL:321931602655707136>
It was yeh
And that brings me back to my original point
Big Mom's the most terrifying emperor shown so far because she's actually been *shown*
Kaido hasn't yet
Oh no, in lore Big Mom has been shown more terrifying
And in portrayal, inarguably it's been Big Mom, sicne Kaido hasn't had much time to *be* portrayed in conflict
Big Mom had a whole arc dedicated to how terrifying she is, kaido's still getting into it
He may be worse by the end of wano, but Big Mom's gotten a full show, and she's been absolutely higher in the horror
Big Mom was actually *shown* to be, Wow
You're skipping over that
Kaido hasn't gotten a chance to live up to his rep, and his reputation really wasn't much more than "He's stronger than everyone"
Big Mom's reputation was "If you disobey, you get a loved one's head in a box"
Thinking he's more threatening isn't the same as him being more terrifying
Big Mom's portrayal through all of WCI has entirely trumped what we've seen of Kaido *so far*
He's been a lot more human than she ever has is the problem
No, from a lore and portrayal standpoint, it's still Big Mom. That's the thing, Kaido's lore has literally just been that no one can hurt or kill him
Big Mom's has been complete domination
His Calamities had a more terrifying reputation than he does, lol
^
No, you're still not getting it, it's not that he's been shown as a big brute, it's that he hasn't been shown as a brute *a tall*
He's basically just been a not even unforgiving general, just one who really wants to fight...sometimes
He's scarred Wano for sure, and his pollution is sad
I've never done that, tho
And I keep putting the label down  lol
Yes, I know, I keep saying he is not
Yes, his lore is him being a brute
*He* has never been
Not at all, his lore has him being defeated
And ends with him being invulnerable
And/or unkillable
Sorry, was on a call again lol
So yeh, my point is that his lore calls him out as this violent creature who's challenged everyone and no one could put him down, even though he's been beaten before
Came out with him being virtually invulnerable, seemingly unkillable, and everyone talking about him talks as if he's pretty much the Hulk
But Kaido himself hasn't really supported those rumors as much, he's been a calculating, purposeful and insightful individual building a functioning army
Yeah exactly, that lore is the best portrayal he's gotten to put him anywhere near as bad as Big Mom has been actualized to be
In actual action, he's been a LOT more mild than she has, but just brutal here and there still
For example, Jack was cruel and sadistic, and I'm sure Queen and King are equally. Kaido has been shown enjoying violence and suffering too, but ultimately, he and his crew have rarely made it much of a game outside of Wano
Yeh, because Kaido's lore is mostly just building him up to be *the* big bad guy of the series
Big Mom's lore has her as a psychopathic monster, and she was fully shown to be the same
One of the first thing we're told about her is that if you deny her invite, she'll send you a loved one's head in a box
Oh, also personality
Big Mom laughs and cackles happily as people are hurt and killed, and enjoys when she gets to do it too
Kaido seems to just do it because people are in his way
Like, I imagine Big Mom would've tortured Orochi for a while before killing him, or even shoved him in Mont D'or's books forever
Kaido may be the guy who will cut your head off without a prior warning, and even enjoy as his crew tortures you, but Big Mom turned it into her own amusement. The wheel she uses alone makes her worse than Kaido in a lot of ways, for me
Pinning it won't stop people from posting it lol
Yeh exactly, he's willing to do things in the most brutal way to get what he wants, but Big Mom enjoys doing it in the slowest, most brutal way, whether she gets what she wants or not
And none of that is even bringing up the rampages too, that adds a whole other level of it for me
Only for now, not like entirely
Ehhh y'know, I think he has been. Only because he's the one who's come up with the New Onigashima Initiative, and that puts him on a whole new level of threat
He's the first Emperor who's decided to declare war on the world and has been working specifically toward it for over two years now, as opposed to Big Mom just chilling and eating
I'm still watching both channels btw lol
Honestly, i'll give you that just because he rose to an Emperor by beating down everyone else and making them part of his crew
Big Mom just wants more resource and a happy family, in her mind anyway
Kaido may not have conquered as much territory, but his crew is almost entirely made of people he's personally taken out it seems
Nah, he's an admiral
It's his job to be that strong lol
Yeh, but only  until we actually get to see Kaido going at it
Unlike WCI, we mostly see his crew being the sadistic ones
As opposed to WCI, where Big Mom was the sadist and her crew just kind of supported it
But on that note as well, her rampages are really interesting to me
The way I view it, that really puts her above everyone as far as fear goes, she kind of becomes this eldritch Lovecraftian symbol for me
Not directly, but only in that she becomes basically someone who doesn't care about your existence it feels
Where she's not chasing people, she's chasing bugs who decided to crawl on her cake
So we go from this person you can talk to and reason with who may be able to blow up an island, to this creature with barely a mind and a ravenous hunger and you happen to be made of ice cream
Who can *also* maybe blow up an island, lmao
Nah, she's never known as far as we know
Nami's got a scar on her back that isn't tattoed
Tbh I can't remember much of Nami's back post-skip in general lol
someone check the bathhouse scene <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Daily PSA:

Marine ranks
Yeh, looks like it's just faded away
But that's also different than the one she had before
Like that? No, that'd never fade
But, this is One Piece
Where it does lol
Armament is a barrier in general, it's just a measure of how far you can project it
Eventually ending in letting it explode in someone/something from the inside out
Rayleigh's the only one who showed that before Luffy learned it
I'm assuming Roger and Whitebeard knew it, too
But, unconfirmed. Seemed to be, tho
<@!155760010410983424> No, everyone else is confusing it more by incorrectly using the term lmao
It should never have gotten to the point of being just normalized as only the new kind of haki Luffy learned when it was never referred to in that way in the first place
Yes, for the first time since its introduction, the one and only time it's ever been used to refer to some specific haki was last chapter
And that wasn't even referred to specifically as the projection, Kaido just asked if they were using Oden's ryuo
We don't know that Oden knew the same lol, so that doesn't even help it
All we know is whatever they hit Kaido with seems to be the same that Oden used
So, it *still* hasn't actually been specifically used for the technique.
And nothing of value was lost <:LUL:321931602655707136>
The only thing is they're not projecting anything so far, they just managed to pierce his skin
So it's definitely not the kind Luffy's been breaking his ass to learn, if it is
It'd have to be the bit that Rayleigh and Sentoumaru knew
Er, Rayleigh showed when training Luffy, he knew both
No Toshiro, I'm saying Oden's haki doesn't have to have been the kind Luffy just learned for hurting Kaido specifically
It just has to be what Oden could do, and he didn't seem actually able to use that form
The internal destruction, that is
Oden didn't seem to actually  know the full form, just the projection bit we see from the admirals and Hyogoro
If even that
It wasn't just a cut to the skin, they plunged their swords into him
Kiku's went straight through his hand
20 years later, sure lol
Back then, yeah it was internal damage, literally every sword slash that happens makes people spit up blood in this show
It's always internal damage, someone was just slashed hard enough that it put them on the ground
The sign of haki is that he was able to damage Kaido *at all*, not that Kaido coughed up blood later
Well, the barrier is the projection
Oden didn't seem to even know about the last stage of Ryuo, let alone use it
Yes, you're projecting your haki forward, the internal destruction is the further kind
Where you're projecting *into* something
He did indeed
But that's natural, Raizo just cut his neck and Kinemon stabbed him in the lungs lol
I'd also like to point out that 100% of his injuries were gone by the time he flew to the roof, lmao
Caught you slippin, pasta <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Laww you could probably pull every sword finisher in this series and show them spitting blood
But yeh, once the sword goes in, that's just natural
'cause you were probably just stabbed or slashes in an internal organ connected to your esophagus
Let's go back to the root of the discussion tho
The use of "ryuo" in the chapter
As much as it was used specifically there for the technique, likely anyway since I can't confirm it for sure, that's still the one and only time it's ever been used for that sake
In his intro, he falls and hurts himself ll
Yeh we've really known he wasn't invincible since then
You should join, lurk in, have some fun
Don't have to talk tho
I'll add a little to that Pasta, throughout WCI we also see him representing Big Mom the most
Like greeting her guests, making Caesar's lab on her request, things of that nature
I wanna say she attends her more than anyone
*he
Kaido's crew seems to care
Just, they're also assholes
Kaido's crew cares as far as like not wanting someone on their crew getting their asses kicked
I imagine it was because it showed he needed help, and thus wasn't the strongest one around
Which goes against Kaido's entire philosophy as a pirate
Hyogoro actually can't do the third
so that list is very wrong
Luffy figured out how to do it on his own, and completely skipped over the second
Sentoumaru and the Boa sisters project their haki forward
Rayleigh was doing the same there
He uses the final stage at Sabaody
when he breaks Caimie's collar
And when he breaks hyogoro's collar
Also, two interesting things I just noticed.
no lmao
Rayleigh is the only person besides Luffy who's used it confirmed
^ What Shimon said
Its your list lmao
^
And Luffy vs Tree
Can't forget that incredible opponent
As powerful as Kaido's scales
The 6th Emperor; Tree.
Alright, so, those two things
Yes, only the second
Luffy skipping straight over the second form and hitting the third perfectly describes him as a character
Ryuo is Wano's philosophy on haki relating it to a flowing energy more than just a solid willpower
So to reach the second stage of use, their technique is let the haki flow into an area instead of focusing it in like with normal imbuing
Presumably it just overflows and starts projecting, and i'm guessing the final form is when it flows so much it goes into the other object entirely and ruptures it
In which case, it fits so well that Luffy poured so much of his heart into that moment, and his haki seemed to follow in kind and broke Hyogoro's collar
I don't really know filler scenes, lol
The second thing I mentioned; the most interesting part of the scene with Kaido and the scabbards is that he saw their attack coming completely
Full on screamed at them that they couldn't hurt him
And yet, he gave 0 defense. No haki, didn't even seem to flex at all
He was just going to let them stab him and is apparently just immune to it, and that's so interesting
Well yeh, I wasn't questioning why he did it lol
But even Big Mom decided to use armament when blocking a hit from Luffy, yet Kaido just takes these things without lifting a finger
He didn't even have to be stabbed, he could've stopped them there lol
But I'm sure did it to make the point that he was invincible, only to get that slap in the face
But the interesting bit is that even in a world filled with haki, there are so few people who exist who can damage him at all that he felt people as strong as Denjiro, Nekomamushi, Inuarashi and Ashura douji couldn't make a scratch on him
Pfft, Kaido full on let himself get stabbed and they got lucky, people can bitch all they want <:LUL:321931602655707136>
kw?
Oh, until Luffy? Yeah, he fought shanks a little
Or, clashed with him in some notable way
Oh, until this chapter?
Yeah, he fought Kid and Luffy
Kid's entire crew, and Luffy
Yeh exactly, he's been hit repeatedly I'm sure
But not by anyone who could actually hurt him lol
The only person we know for sure has even survived is Perospero right now lol
Big Mom washed ashore, that saved her
Just like Luffy
Well, Kaido absolutely could have, with ease
Oh yeh, lmao
But yeah, apparently they fought until they couldn't fight anymore
Unless I'm mistaken, I believe Hawkins explains it to Law
And I'm sure having conqueror's was a huge flag for Kaido
Nah, it's a war
Odds are it'll be almost entirely group skirmishes and maybe one or two 1v1's
Kid?
I don't think Kid knew this second armament tbh
^ that too, it's just filler
so you can assume it was, sure
This was also long before anyone found out about the third stage
So all they would've known is that Rayleigh could project it
'cause we saw that happening back then already
That's exactly why it doesn't matter
Kamui, we got a close up of him smiling way happier than that at the beginning of wano
Yep
Fantastic moment, too
Why would he hurt his hand?
Bruh, I can't break a mountain with my punches
lmao
Why would Rayleigh be hurt punching rubber?
It's not hardened there yeh
Luffy only imbues his arms and legs
It doesn't go across his torso unless he's getting hit in it
She was having a conversation with Oda and dropping just too many spoilers man
Doom did it to protect the integrity of the server <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Not in this show they aren't, lol
Dressrosa was one of the best arcs for introducing the best admiral
Just gonna throw that out there
I've seen some talk about why Fujitora stopped Zoro
Or if Zoro would've beaten Doflamingo or anything
Nah, there's no world where Zoro would've won that fight
'Cause it wasn't for him to win <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Swrml, you forget his week long training arc
In which he went from 5th Emperor's commander to the 6th Emperor <:CrocoKid:487633532907159552>
^
Also the only reason we still have a Zoro
Because let's be real, if Fujitora weren't weighing his options there
Zoro would be in Impel Down
While I don't disagree that he could've, I just like to think Fujitora would've preferred just arresting him than killing him
Because of their earlier exchange, he even felt bad about having to beat them down there rofl
I love him so much, he's the best part of Dressrosa for me
Him and Kyros
...and Sai. And Lao G.
Very happy that Oda introduced him
It's nice to see Smoker's ambition represented by someone who has pretty much the third highest pull in the marines
And can actually get things done
I'm excited to see what else he ends up doing
Yeah, made me realize
If not for the fact that the government covered it up, the Warlords would've been dismantled as soon as Alabasta happened
If that were to happen, then Marineford would never have happened lol
The Summit War wasn't a thing back then, sexy
Because it wasn't just Croc taking over, it's that pirates saved them while the marines were powerless
Showing the warlords were something they couldn't keep in check, and were therefore inherently dangerous
that's why they covered it up with Smoker taking the credit instead
^ I disagree on it being stupid
Def a nice concept
It added so many more layers of depth to the series
Along with the perfect measure for natural world building
Well, to be fair, there's a little nuance there as well
Only two warlords were ever actually bad for the world, and one wasn't invited, he forced his way in lol
Well, three really
'cause Weevil's got one of the highest body counts in the series
But he does it by accident lmao
Moria was one of the most beneficial members
Yeh vegito, they don't know she actually did all that lol
It's not like they excused it
Moria was removing hundreds of pirates from the sea
He was doing the actual job of the warlords, lmao
During Marineford, not after
Or epically wounded them rather
She turns them to stone
Kiiiinda JSG, but I only say kinda because he didn't do much to the world as a warlord
and he took out Ace, which was kind of beneficial
But also not because he caused the Summit War, and that fucked up the New World really hard
<@!274366418223497217> You're right, a good part of having warlords in general was actually to deter other pirates
That's why it was never a question of strength for Blackbeard joining
Or Buggy
Moria only got kicked out when he was publicly defeated

So like
I feel like this would've been such a good thing to do
Just the perfect plan tbh
Have Big Mom jump in, kill Doflamingo and Fujitora
Or die to them, alternatively
And have Kaido blame everything on her instead of Law
<@!274366418223497217> Pfft, details details. <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Also true, lmfao
they did not save that country
they just saved its future <:LUL:321931602655707136>
It kinda was, the whole country was shredded and Fujitora threw all the rubble in the sea lmfao
I don't think they ever addressed that
Tbh archer
There wouldn't have been many of those left either <:KataLUL:562005179571109888>
If not for Fujitora, there would've been almost none of those left in the arc tbh
<@!274366418223497217> Both, but I think we get a scale when we see Pica going for it right?
!modlogs 738444922390315109

I'm definitely onboard for banning, he's been a disruptive and pretty crass user since he joined 😐

Manga 👍🏾
the only connection to Momo that trumps the general rest of the crew is Luffy's
Everyone else is pretty equal
As much as momonosuke may hang with them all, a perverted affection doesn't trump the fact that Sanji's risked his life for Momonosuke as much as anyone
Being part of the crew in general is all he needs, just like Luffy wasn't the one who helped Kid in Udon
But it still meant a lot because it was Luffy's ally
In fact, it was Raizo, someone Kid had hardly ever even seen before in his life
^
Lots of swordsmen have fruits
Diamante, Pica, Kinemon, Kaku, any gifter swordsman out there
Presumably King
Jack is also somewhat a swordsman
Saving Momonosuke won't be that powerful of a moment imo
Bon Clay's sacrifice was a huge moment, yes
And Galdino helping with Ace was huge, sure
But
That's because the entirety of Marineford was about rescuing Ace
This raid is not about rescuing Momonosuke
That's just an item on the to-do list
Yeh, it's a part of it, and it's something to do
But the powerful moment will be who wins, not who frees Momo when he has hundreds of allies right next to him already
It's been a while because it took a while for the raid to start
But they're not there to save Momonosuke
They're there to kill Kaido
Momo is easy, that's probably the smallest part of this entire ordeal tbh
It's not like they had to cook up this plan just to get him back, like in Marineford
Sure, but Momo being saved is not the powerful moment
And who does it isn't entirely relevant
He can be saved by the Strawhats and samurai together while Luffy is fighting Big Mom, and have the powerful moment be his win
That'd b e awesome
but he just doesn't have to be cut down by someone in particular, that he is rescued at all is more important
Thing is
Momo's a big deal, but he's so overshadowed by everything else in the raid

That this is the only mention of him at all this chapter <:LUL:321931602655707136>
And it's really just an inference at that
Maybe Yamato will end up taking Ulti and Page One together
All of the Flying Six are after her, so it would be a great set up
If Who's Who were stronger than Luffy, he'd already be a commander lol

BUT LIKE. REALLY KAIDO?
It just still tickles me
Kaido for real goes "you were hiding from me!"
Orochi:
I wish we could've seen his face when all 9 scabbards broke through
But unfortunately it was on the floor
Yes, Kinemon helped Zoro push it
with Kanjuro and Fujitora

Queen and Big Mom having fantastic chemistry
not even talking to each other

Anyone notice the minks are all covering their eyes as they get up first?
I love it
That was your first mistake
<@!211762789109334016> Hey I found your selfie

<@!484353797431230464> Is something wrong with your keyboard? You're gonna have to stop that
LMAO
I forgot that existed lmfao
That's right lucian, gotta keep the curds strong
It's okay moe
I'll make you one of those too rofl
LOL
Queen fights with viruses
What do you mean no nuance?
I've made one before, lucian
Just never kept it up
I'd be down, but I can't guarantee internet stability
They don't need to overpower Queen
They just need to down him
Chopper could even infect him with his own virus or something
!ban 742879653441568810 Name.
Like....like our earth?
'cause I got news for you if you mean one piece <:LUL:321931602655707136>
lmao
Well, like I said, disease works
That's the thing about it, viruses can kill no matter how big you are
He might be able to, but yeh if we assume he can, that's still just generally something they can do to fight him
Like, even if it's something he can fight off, as long as it weakens him enough that Franky Shogun can take him down or something, it' fine
chill with the caps
lol
Killua, goddammit lmao
I can't even say you're wrong
It's an organic process rofl
You'll probably get one eventually maybe
<@!372464153480134666> Was that not invisibility that helped it?
Ah true yeh
It's not like the suki suki
!warn 654315513203392543 Can't seem to stop using caps after being told
!ban 654315513203392543 3h "Bye u fcknbs" and various insults when argued with in chat
Guys
He's gone
Move on along pls
!reason 4141 "Bye u fcknbs" and various insults when argued with in chat, not a user that seems to be able to get along well in chat.
Sanji dodged things faster and stronger than bullets
In rapid succession, repeatedly lol
But, being able to do something in one situation doesn't mean you'll be able to in *every* situation
Oda focuses a lot on circumstance
Yeah, that was after working for 12 hours straight, being in multiple fights and being surrounded
And while carrying someone
*And* with tons and tons of stress, lol
Lmao it spreads out here too
Let's not tho pls
fffffffffff there's been talk of a food channel
But it probably wouldn't get used enough lmao
^
There may be like 5 active users in a food channel in total, being generous
Or at least, I never see more than a few folks talk about cooking
And they say post-skip gags aren't as good as pre-skip pffft
LOL
YC, it'd just be <#164971940648321024> after every other chapter really
<@!283276421470748673> Funny enough, most of <#738580480437387264> has been pretty decent convo <:LUL:321931602655707136> I'm happy for how it's turned out
But let's not talk too much about the manga channels
Don't want anyone thinking they can talk about the chap here
Lmao, it's like the new faction wars
It just won't stop, may as well bring those back too <:LUL:321931602655707136>
That's why we got the backup and slow mode
Makes it a lil easier
Thing is guys
If <#164971940648321024> gets you down a bit, please go jump into <#738580480437387264> when it's up
Don't have to avoid weird convos or too much aggression or strange shitposting for the most part if you're less comfortable with the regulars
It can be a nice way to ease a transition into the manga crowd too
Not to bless either channel for the purpose expressly, but if it's not right in one, hop in the other and keep on goin
<@!155760010410983424> It's their bodies that start burning up
Being in Sulong for too long slowly kills them, it's like monster point pre-skip
He's an alt of the guy I just banned
I'm 100% sure
He's doing the same thing that one did, caps and lashing out when no one agreed
<@!160778857702490113>
God?
Feel free to boot him if you want, I got no doubts lol
Rofl, I'm not surprised at all that he came back
They didn't even try to give him fingers
Guys, try not to crowd up on someone
<@!334398834815926275> It can easily be misconstrued the other way too though, just trying not to let a mob happen
Ohfuck my bad, it was going to be a mute until he was super toxic
I must have not noticed the 3H in it still lmao
He sent that to me too, and he's also posted the video multiple places in the server, I think someone should have a chat with him lol
Most people in this series do
Akainu didn't have plot armor
He's an admiral
It's his job to be strong enough to fight an Emperor
Why would one be able to kill him in one hit? What kind of balance could there possibly be if they could? <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Hundreds of injuries
And this is an admiral
^ It's not like an admiral had been taken down before that moment
That was Oda telling you this is who these people are lol
Oo dang, are you okay? Just exhausted?
You guys turn this place into it every hour anyway <:LUL:321931602655707136>
Eh, he could be worse
<@!352120879439675392> That was hilarious <:LUL:321931602655707136>
> I've noticed that there's a really common theme of betrayal in Wano. <@!524603876482220093> And funny enough, it's almost completely been on Kaido/Orochi's side lmao
That just seems to be the general theme there, funny enough
For pirates, that is
It's almost universally the negative choice that is the stereotype
Tried to sacrifice Kaido, lmfao
Break week, don't need a place for the extra traffic right now
The Rocks pirates constantly killed each other
"Betrayal" for them would probably be helping each other lol
Not how, just where
Eh, I doubt Whitebeard would even feel the need to make a deal
He was probably the second strongest member of the crew, considering where he went soon after
