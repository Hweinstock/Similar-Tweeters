I don't get it
Damn that's crazy
You know what else is crazy?
People thinking Carrot is a better candidate for a strawhat member than Yamato
Captain Crunch is like eating knives
I like having not a bloody mouth
How old his sister's tho 👀
My dog Sanji out here
Can't beat black beard so just clap his sisters in God 😔🙏
On*
Dogs are cool
I have a husky
Yeah actually
Except it's spelled Maverick
Uh that depends tbh
I'm an actual pretty high class chef so Sanji sick but I also love Zoro
And sabo epic
Yeah it ain't easy
You know who's not my favorite tho?
Carrot 😐
Yamato > Carrot
I would've liked Carrot if she had more personality and was actually intriguing
Not saying she's a bad character
In fact I think she's one of the best side characters introduced in the mink arc
But as a strawhat to me she'd be the weakest strawhat character wise
> I find that Shirahoshi has the power to command the Sea Kings. Momo has apparently the power to command Zunesha. Luffy is probably only able to hear the creatures speak, and hear the voices coming from the Poneglyphs. He may not understand what they are saying, but he can feel their pain and their hopes, fears, angers, joy, etc. At least, that's what i assume. <@526953063089438720>   I genuinely don't know why if this is true he couldn't hear the poneglyphs before
If Roger who also had the voices of all things could do it why couldn't Luffy
> Carrot has a lot of personality wtf <@203091600283271169>  compared to other side characters yeah, compared to other strawhats not at all
> I mean she has proven her usefulness. Carrot joining still sounds way better than a helpless 8 year old Tama joining. Who’d probably just get kidnaped by some low tier pirate <@142923564423577601>  I agree, I don't think she's a terrible edition to the crew but she's had such little exposition of her character
> <@!521783526878609418> He probably activated it later on, during the two year timeskip. I guess it must have been a hidden power of his but it only came to surface recently. <@526953063089438720>  The truth is probably Oda came up with it later on but yeah that would be a good way for Oda to work around him not writing it in earlier
> I never understood why people dont want carrot and jimbe as straw hats <@203091600283271169>  Nah I'm not a carrot hater but it seems like Oda just hasn't done enough for her to join the crew tbh
I want her to join just to have other races
> <@521783526878609418> reread WCI <@203091600283271169>  She played as much a roll in WCI as any other side character in every other arc
The gladiator homeboy in dressrosa did more but he ain't joining
Being friends with two characters doesn't make them a crew member
Im not against her joining
I'm against her joining as she is now with little character and almost actual substance to her
I think it'd be super cool to have a mink
> I wonder what Robin and Carrot's dynamic would be <@153273023456083969>  Big sis vibes prob
> Robin big sister maybe <@419608704418054157>  Yup
> I think she's got enough interaction with the WCI strawhats, enough moments and all, and ofc the Pedro situation that I'd be fine with her joining, and there's still room for more in Onigashima <@372464153480134666>  Exactly I'm hoping Oda make Sher integral in Onigashima as so many people are attached to her already that it'd be better for the community if he just did something to make her a better fit then leave her as she is and not put her on the crew
> <@!521783526878609418> It is possible Oda had the whole concept of Haki planted in his head for some time. When Shanks gave that sea king a glare, the sea king backed off. It is highly possible, that he wanted to introduce it, but it was too early for that. Because the concept was heavily focused on Devil Fruits, and how obscure and dangerous DF users were at the time. <@526953063089438720>  Oh my bad I should've specified, I think Oda thought of haki since early on I meant the voices of all things
My bad
Peros a good big mom commander I like him enough
Power? Robin
She straight up assassinated people for a long time
> Aside from nami who do you think is closer with robin? <@142923564423577601>  Franky
Yeah for sure but I'm just saying in a 1v1 Robin would kill Nami
LMAO
Global warming jokes
And is Robin has Zeus Idk is she's the weakest if we talking straight power output
If* Nami*
Lmao my bad
I think she has to see where she's putting them no?
One piece best waifu? Bruh that's tuff
Yamato cool
Town boy type vibes
Rebecca tho
Vivi annoying sometimes not about it
Strawhats closest to Luffy are Nami and Zoro then Ussop and Sanji
Not closest but know him the best ig
Thatd be able to read his mind the best ig
Monet as annoying as Vivi without any of the good
Tashigi the goat
Yeah sometimes
At least to me
Being a crybaby
Exactly
How can the same person who literally became a double agent in a criminal organization be a so childish later
Not saying I don't like her because there's a lot of good
> If she was a male nobody would mind it <@683663101186277416> this just isn't true at all
At least for me she isn't my favorite at all and it has nothing to do with her gender or race as I love Yamato and would love a mink on the crew
Most strawhats have an entire arc while Carrot has just been a side character
> Well thats you alex. Alot of people don't feel that way <@683663101186277416>  A bunch of people in this chat felt the same way when we just talked about it like 15 minutes ago
Why people want obviously side characters to join I'm confused
> But her arc isn't over yet and she's a part of this war <@190325050593902593>  Yeah like I said earlier I really hope Oda makes her relevant now that the minks are going solung because I genuinely want a minks on the crew
I hope Oda does something to make her SH material cause rn she just isn't when compared to literally every other strawhat
> Carrot put in a lot of work in WCI, more than practically any "just side characters" <@534844218376585227>  What'd she do besides use her sulang and be just a living creature on the sunny?
She has done no wear near as much as every other strawhat has done before joining
Fuck u right she helped her change nvm
Pedro would've been cooler just because of the hisorey
> So she has to do more work than all of the other strawhats who's had more time in the crew than her?<@521783526878609418> <@683663101186277416>  No she hasn't done no wear near as much work as any of the straw hats before joining the crew
Every strawhat has had an entire arc for them
Carrot is has been in the story for literally years now
> isn't over <@372464153480134666>  Ik and Ive said multiple times I hope she becomes more relevant
But literally replace Carrot with any other female mink and the same shit would've happened she isn't unique in any way, every other strawhat is completely unlike anyone else
You > Carrot did more than zoro amd nami did when they tried to join the crew <@683663101186277416> Nami had an entire arc later on and Zoro was before one piece wasn't even like confirmed at all to be an ongoing show we had stories in 1 episode back then
> Replace zoro with any other sword fighter he isn't unique in any way <@683663101186277416>  No that's just incorrect, how many swords man do we meet that wanna be the best in the world and beat mihawk?
How many use 3 swords?
Saying Zoro is like every other swordsman literally makes no sense
If you truly think every character in the show is generic and unsoecial then downtbwatch the show
No it's not because one is a main character and one is a side character
Except it does when any other female mink who is trained in sulong could've done what she did
Carrot pretty much exactly like that other dog mink
What? I'm saying any female mink who has sulong could've donenwhat she did in WCI
Do you think any swordsman could've done what Zoro has done?
Not any but obviously any that have trained in it
But not any strong swordsman has the personality traits that Zoro does
Literally all the female minks are the same.thing
Bruh
That dog mink legit was just carrot but as a dog
Carrot is generic
> This is kinda bordering sexism wtf <@190325050593902593>  Nah I have no problem with a female Mink as long as they have an actual personality
> Whats a personality to you then <@190325050593902593>  Specifically for the straw hats? A dream ig
Wanting to just travel isnt an actual compelling dream bro
She likes jelly beans?  You right bro she gonna join the crew 😔
Look I have nothing against Carrot as a character
> What's chopper's dream? <@683663101186277416>  Wanting to create a medicine that cures everything
Have u not seen the show?
> their only similarity is garchu which is a similarity among every mink <@372464153480134666>  But one the only trait a character has is that they're cute it's not an actual personality
> Damn Brook's dream is to see Laboon again? Thats not compelling at all <@683663101186277416>  Are you a clown? Homie lost his entire crew
> <@521783526878609418>  are you caught up to the manga lol? <@477218487903977483>  Yeah bro Imk what carrot has done in wano
Jack shit
> What has robin done in wano <@190325050593902593>  > She's about to <@662544074015899649>  And like I said earlier I truly hope so as like we can see here so many people want her to join
> Do you see how that dream argument falls apart then? <@521783526878609418> <@683663101186277416>  Nothing's falling apart lmao you're just saying a characters dreams aren't compelling when they are
> Alex check what I said about what her dream can be it's not just adventuring <@662544074015899649>  Where?
I genuinely want her to do something cool to join the crew
But the fact that she just us alive and hasn't done anything heart moving or anything is pretty obvious that shes a side character
Is*
At the end of the day bro this is all just opinion right?
We won't know for sure until something does or doesn't happen
Yeah except they've all already had an arc to themselves bud
> Well it is a fact that she has a dream and it is a fact that she has done alot <@683663101186277416>  "Alot" yeah ight
> For carrot, it can be to help the strawhats bring about the dawn which is Pedro's last words to her <@662544074015899649>  You see that would be fucking amazing! But guess what it hasn't happened yet
> Nah you made a claim she did nothing heart moving and that it made it obvious she was a side character. Those are claims about the story, not just opinions <@415999229564157955>  Nah, in my opinion she hasn't done anything heart moving
> Again she has done more than what nami and zoro did when they first joined the crew<@521783526878609418> <@683663101186277416>  Except literally 2 arcs later Nami got her own arc
Carrot been in the crew for legit 2 years now real time and she ain't do shit
> So would you have doubted Nami joining as much before those two arcs? <@372464153480134666>  Imagine comparing an anime establishing itself to an anime 20 years later that has the ability to do pretty much anything Oda wants
If Oda wanted to make carrot a straw hat he would've
She cried when someone died? Damn bro you right she's the best character
Why didn't he focus on her during the mink arx?
You crying at a death isn't development bro
Breaking down infront of Luffy asking for help is development
Look how about we wait and see if she joins
If you're right I'll admit I'm wrong
If I'm right you all can admit you're wrong
> It's being open to her joining <@662544074015899649>  You just ignoring everything I've said about me wanting her to join?
Im plenty open with her joining in my opinion she just needs more development to fit in with the crew
> So forgive me for jumping to conclusions <@662544074015899649>  It's chill no one here mad or anything we all one piece fans at the end of the day
We all trust Oda
On God
Literally asked to join before Luffy could invite her
Homes I'm moving on I've already stated my opinion
You're welcome to have yours
Ok bud
You're right it's an assumption on something that isn't clearly stated
It's the way you are perceiving Odas work
I have the right to perceive it any way I want
That's how art works 😀
Until Oda comes out and says yes or no to her joining we can all just make assumptions and opinions on  what we got
W
Now then let's get to the real important stuff
Who's gonna get the last hit on Kaido?
Frost you are built different
What if kaido is actually that fat form we saw in the beginning of one piece
Idk how I feel about that theory
And the form we see is his hybrid
The only reason I even consider the theory is to point out how far Oda thinks into the future
Yeah
Ik but stfu
We can't let others know
Oda God he's known everything since chapter 1 trust
It was to show how he's a double crossing two face
See on purpose
On purpose bro
It was a hint
Na Na Oda a god trust
Yo some Sanjitard tried telling me sanni 1000× stronger than Zoro cause Zoro got knocked out by killer
> Why are the people that do nothing but shit on one piece and the people that do nothing but praise Oda  at every thing the same level of annoying <@248949219564584962>  I was being sarcastic bud
Imagine not understanding sarcasm
> oda doesnt miss <@161561601944584195>  He just built different
Ig but when it's that obvious 👀
> <@!521783526878609418> You know there are people who simply can't, I hope <@415999229564157955>  Yeah my brothers autistic got it
I said trust at the end I thought that was pretty indicative of a joke
It's chill
No one should be mad at anyone here
We all one piece fans
> One piece is dumb and ugly and I hate it <@272064319661801473>  Same
Like why's it so long
If you like the minks or fishman you a disgusting furry gross, and devil fruit? Is that like bad Naruto jitsu's or something
Dummies
Just waiting for the day Luffy reveals his genius to us all
Morgan saw it why can't we 😔
Fifth yonko who?
Ight can I start an actual debate tho?
Why people think the admirals are stronger than Yonkos?
Lmao my bad I was giving you guys a prompt
Have had it
Because I genuinely can't understand why people think they stronger in a 1 v 1
Homies saw a dying white beard die and went damn ig the yonkos are vice admiral level Max 🤷‍♂️
Connected to machines to be able to live day to day, dies to admirals, YO YONKOS WEAK
I can't understand if Kin'emon is strong or not
It hurts my mind
Yeah that's why
But also why didn't he fight back throughout the whole dressrosa thing
Yeah but that's also the man who legit ruined his entire life
Well
Admirals are closer than the rest
I agree titles don't equal level
But I'd say admiral is the closest thing to a set level we have
> all yonko stand a good chance agaisnt other yonko. All admials have a good chancce against each other <@380840459641159683>  Yeah for me Yonko and Admiral are the only 2 groups that within each could theoretically even each other out for a while admiral vs admiral or yonko vs yonko
People be saying 3 yonko commander like that should mean something
3 pirate king crew seat 4 edition fat cock level
No
1 v 1
No
Yeah
Same with doofy
But none of those characters 1 shot him instantly while in gear fourth
Kaido a monster
Bro 5 that's a lot
We need 2 life on the sunny chapters
I think if Luffy now went up against katakuri he'd beat him for sure
The first time not so much
But I won't dispute he won
So like half baths
Binge watch the whole show in 3 days
I had a friend in middle school who didn't leave his room for a month and binged it, he was a momma's boy tho so she did everything for him so he could do that easily
This was back in early dressrosa
Or even before can't really remember
But shit was crazy
Mans bathroom was connected to his room so he could shit while watching
Props to the boy Kevin he was a legend
Hey guys starting Marineford arc can't wait for Luffy to save Ace
Maybe he'll even join the crew to help get them back together that'd be sick
I wonder how good Moria is with his Devil fruit
Depending on how good he is with it will decide if Blackbeard lets him live or not
Considering how much time he's had it tho he's probably good with it
Wapol a business man <:NamiMoney:586664755536724030>
Wapol IS rich
It's true I was is
No piece
Let me tell y'all how Monkey Dragon is actually
Luffys dad
Nah people always confuse it
His name isn't monkey d dragon
It's monkey d ragon
Be D po
San D ji is so cool
Quaran D tine
Oohh my bad
Fuck is there a break?
Bruh
O d. a
Omg Oda you sick bastard
Sa d.
Y'all should read kingdom
I'm sure ik at some point and just forgot
It says it at the end of the chapter
No the anime is bad please God no don't watch it
The manga of kingdom is amazing
The anime is hot garbage
I agree it's amazing
The snow is gonna be such a nice touch when it's animated
Wait aren't Dragons weak to snow?
Oda loves Pokemon it's a hint omg
> <@!521783526878609418> Since when? <@162731766799532032>  I'm Pokemon Dragon types are weak to ice types
Yes
Editor a lil bitch that's why he cried
I bet I could 1v1 him real life shit
Bruh even better that was like last year
The editor is only 1 year old
I could fight a baby easy
Dumb ass baby of course he cried
He's a baby
Babies cry guys relax not his fault
Idek who Mr. Morj is
Is that a YouTuber?
I only watch Tekking101 and Totallynotmark
Idk him but he sounds kinda crazy
The brick is a lil much but I still like his content like towards the middle of the videos
Just skip pass the beginning lmao
I'm so excited for the next totally not mark video
It's like reliving one piece all over again
I love it
Why people hate Zoro besides Oda not always using him to his fullest is beyong me
Like yeah he's usually just there to fight the second in command and that's about it but who cares
Nah sanjitards hate him
I like em both
LMAO
Good point
Sanji can be a lil too much but his core character is good
Wdym
He literally risked his life for Luffy
I think it is cool
Yeah gin is awesome
Wish he came back as part of a yonko crew or something
Nah Zoro nothing happened still the most impactful for me tbh
How many living creatures have the will power to go through that for another human without dying
He has a bunch of amazing scenes
Daz bones was an amazing early one
The one moment that I think when u look at it in hindsight is as crazy is Arlong looking at Zoros wounds
That moment gives me goosebumps still
Arlong puking
How do I use these bots
!oda
I see
Gin was best antogonist before arlong
Lmao he's a cool character
I hope he comes into play in the final war
He gets last hit on kaido
Yes
Nah bro he has an iron clad will
<:GinCry:586660443775565854>
I agree
Oda doesn't just kill off characters unless it's important
Yeah but the hormones still had like a 5% survival rate or something
Gin just wants food
Shim you ok buddy?
Wapol is yonko level tbh
Like whose gonna stop wapol?
It didn't work he still alive
He'll just eat bb darkness
Eat usopps shots
He's obviously indestructible
Literally probably one of the richest none celestial humans
Apoo is yonko level easy
Roger died to apoo tbh we didn't see it so maybe
It's ok Mike
We can we all love One piece here that's the only language we need
Speak through emojis
<:WBeardWhat:638862189771620372>
<:ZoroNut:632474447462400010>
<:ZoroWeary:701983967041159169>
I only speak Spanish and french
And English
Ace so cool
Can't wait to see him again
> It never makes sense to me why people who aren't caught up with the series hang out here <@287712421165137920>  Nah I was just joking in the general chat I've read every chapter 💀
Nah Mike he means me
LMAO yeah
Thanks for being an actually good guy tho Strong right
I was waiting for the donut jokes but I actually were a good person
Lmao u a legend strong right
One piece my favorite manga my #2 was bnha but that shit fell off
Y'all should read kingdom it's really good just long
So if u want something long like one piece
Go read that
Same
I'm a real life Florida man
Well Miami boy so a lil difficult
> Damn. ||someone who started one piece that wasn't spoiled on that gigantic moment is like a unicorn|| Marineford spoiler <@287712421165137920>  Lmao u a legend man thanks for trying to not have me spoiled 🙏
Also yeah Ive been watching since early elementary school and before maybe so I can't remember if I was even spoiled back then
Like I just graduated high school and I've been watching one piece since like my earliest memory
Yeah I can't remember if ik or not
I might've been spoiled but idk for sure lol
I remember I thought that Arlong was a warlord in 6th grade for some reason
Im getting a one piece tattoo
I'm in between strawhat logo or the sun pirate tattoo
Yeah that's what I'm thinking
Or maybe both tbh
Lmao idky but a back tattoo sounds so scary to me
I'ma only do chest tats
Ig cause I can't see what's happening
Yeah Law was my fave character during my edgy 7nth grade phase
Wait this is general let me now say stuff
How can I do that spoiler block thing?
| like this? |
Nah that didn't work
Ooo
||pizza||
Let's goo ight
|| after punk hazard law has slowly become more and more of just another side character which is super sad because he's awesome ||
|| It seems like Oda has decided he's served his purpose pretty much ||
He's basically the catalyst of the entire yonko saga
Kanjuro knocked out
Gone
Slep
Slump
Shleep
So you think Oda knew since the intro of him that he was the traitor?
For sure wasn't there some evidence people found?
Yeah
I wonder how far ahead he planned certain concepts
Like you think he thought about yonko since day one?
I mean from intro to traitor is like 2 arcs that's not that far ahead
But from chapter one to yonko introduction
Or to haki
Or to imsama
You think he knew about imsama since romance dawn?
I doubt at first he has planned even the new world during romance dawn
Had*
Idk the way characters know about the grandline but no one mentioned the new world at all until thrillerbark?
Yeah when writing a manga you can't write it like it's gonna last 900 chapters
He wrote the manga not knowing how long it would last
Obviously now he can think as far into the future as he wants
Dr. Stone got slow for me when they got to that other island
Yeah now I think he has the liberty to think that far into the future
But at first he literally didn't know if he would reach passed 100 chapters
What? The log pose route was in paradise tho
I don't really think so
Yeah because that was chapter 100 and it's rare for mangas to get passed 100
Compare the amount of manga that are started versus the amount that make it
Thinking Oda knew since day one that it'd get this far is pretty crazy
I think Oda is good at working new things into old things
Yeah
Exactly
The thought of a "second half" seems like oh shit this manga is going places
Once he hit thriller bark I think from there Oda was like shit this is going places
Or maybe after Alabasta
Oh yeah I'm not gonna dispute that at all
But that idea doesn't seem like something a manga artist just "trying to make it" would do and seems like something a manga that "needs to continue" would do
You don't over extend yourself because then you get a bad manga that looks bad in your portfolio for future projects
But once it's off its feet then you can go all out
Yeah One piece isn't really just a manga or anime to me
I've been consuming one piece since as far back as I can remember 💀
Yeah I mean it has more sentimental value to me m8
Go read Kingdom if you want a long series that you gotta use brain power for
I'm not scared about anything from Oda
I trust him lmao
Do I have things I want him to do? Yeah but I trust
I can't stand JoyBoy
He's voice literally makes me cringe idky
Like literally I can't even watch his videos at all
Not his voice but the way he says things
Idk he also made a video I really disagreed with but I don't remember it was years ago probably
Roger is cool but kinda too much for me
Tekking is great when he's not being crazy
Yeah I like his crazy don't get me wrong but when he starts talking about it I'm all in
Yeah for sure he's the only anime YouTuber I watch daily
Yes exactly
He's also a genuinely good person
Tekking really does have a good heart
I remember when everything involving BLM and George Flyod first happened he was genuinely brought to tears and made a really heart warming speach unlike any other YouTuber making a speach just to make one
It seemed like he does what he does not for others but because it's what he truly believes
I love companies like Rooster teeth but once you're that big of a company they act like they have to say something to set an image for their company and while that's   not bad in any way it seems so much more personal when it came from Tekkings heart and not a PR board
Omg I didn't even think of that
Eneru comes back and kills kaido
LMAO
Piccalo vibes
LMAO
8 mile
But like 8 watts
Cant everyone fly if they're strong enough?
Well ig it depends on your definition of "fly"
This channel is beautiful and genuinely brought a tear to my eye so happy to see everyone catching up and enjoying one piece
I mean if the user is strong enough yeah sure
Just kick the air
Yeah that too
||Also his is a weird fruit||
|| Oda does break set rules of the general df types and while some people might be against that I think it allows us to be surprised here and there by weird fruits like the mud fruit ||
Nah but if he tries running bb has 2 choices
Kill him or capture him
If it would be more of a hastle to give the fruit to a new inexperienced user
Then he'll capture him
I think it comes down to if bb see's moria's skill with the fruit as more of a benefit than just killing him and replacing him
Nah you guys misunderstood
They're saying there's one more SAGA after this one
Not arc
To be fair we're half way through this saga and it's been like 3-4 years already
So it kinda makes sense
But I agree yeah I thought 2 more sagas
Same
While I don't want a bad sequal like Boruto
I do at the same time
Yes or Roger
Or Coby
Yeah there's so many characters that have important histories
I think a lot of the shanks yonko arc is gonna be flash backs
While that would be cool idk how the end of the story would affect the world at large so idk about a Luffy kid adventure
Yeah it's the manga channel
Yeah that'd be cool with Luffy acting as the shanks
Kinda like Sinbad but backwards
That show is so much better than the original
I mean there's a difference between spoilers and just talking about a character that has been in the manga for a long time
I think the spoiler channel is for the spoilers for the next chapter no?
Nah as long as it's current or before we good
Yeah they said Makinos son which would be a spoiler to people not caught up
They mean spoilers as leaks and stuff
Yeah
Haki stuffs
My bad guys I was on a spiritual journey
On it found something
I know who's the best JOJO
Without a doubt it's Joseph Jostar
Stans are worse than hamon
I mean one piece 20 years old
21*
So you know about the.
Then*
Fair enough
Discord was made 23 years ago
<:ZoroWeary:701983967041159169>
That's insane
Bro how many years have we been in the yonko saga?
I mean yeah makes sense 50 ish a year times 4 = 200
Yeah makes sense why there's only 1 more data left
Saga*
If this one taking 10 fucking years and the next one even longer no worries boys
We still got double the life span
Ah this is insane
When do you guys count the Yonko saga starting?
I was thinking punk hazard
Punk hazard when they official made the alliance to take down Kaido
If the yonko saga started in punk hazard
That was 8 years ago
Almost an entire decade in one saga
And we haven't even finished dealing with 2 yonkos yet
Lmao
Nvm the yonko saga officially starts on Zou
So for half a decade
Which means if it takes the same amount of time to do shanks and bb as kaido and bigmom
That's a decade long saga
And we got 1 more
So 15 more years in one piece 👀👀👀
5 for the second half of this saga
And 10 for the last saga if it's the same length as this one
On God
<:EnelLUL:544293696397508618>
Yeah but it's Oda
He said Wano isnt starting for 3 years and it started the next year
7 years would be epic
I don't see why Shanks wouldn't be apart of the yonko saga
Maybe
Yes
<:ZoroWeary:701983967041159169>
<:Sanjimmhmmm:592245193101541376>
Yes
Nope
Copying me
No
! yup
Guys
Do u think Luffy will become pirate king? CIRCLE YES OR NO
Ussop op
He can shoot people
From afar
Crazy shif
Wci not my favorite arc by far
All arcs all good arcs except one lol
It's one-piece I don't hate anything
Yeah skypea wayyyyy better in the manga pacing is just insanely better
I'ma start watching wano because the animation so good
I've just been reading it
Yeah especially when the big war starts in like a year or some shit 💀
At least one piece isn't my hero
Straight up like 4 years ahead in the manga
I'd say over all the anime is better than the manga
Yeah it's seasonal
But also a weekly manga series
That makes no sense
It's not like they'll ever run out of content
Bnha viewer count especially for the last season was shit
If bnha was weekly instead of seasonal it'd by insanely more relevant
Idk one piece pretty fire now
Fire force
Maybe quality wise but when talking about viewers wise
It's literally tanked
You can look at viewer count and it's a parabola lmao
Idk I read it in an article after the end of the lesson
Season*
I'm sure you could find it online somewhere
Less people watch My hero than ever
One piece isn't loosing viewers
It's gaining
My hero isn't gaining
Yeah spoiler for bnha ig || the manga has gone to Shit and the only thing that could fix it is animation but that won't happen for like 4 years ||
He has black her still lmao he isn't that old
Probably all the stress from dealing with Zoro
Oda about to troll us and not talk about it all in any way
Idk 2nd and 3rd cousins kinda convoluted especially a shonen for like younger audiences
It might be a lil too complicated for kids to get probably easier to just say cousins and not dive that deep into it
Never is a strong word
You know those good ol post arc info dumps?
After wano i hope we have one for like 10 chapters lmao
When the war ends the strawhats don't just instantly disappear from wano
I think after the war we're gonna get heavy exposition
Why'd people hate it?
> <@564773067969265674> many thought the dancing was just to fill the 5 years gap <@426750321893703683>  I can see that but, that also shows how much of an iron clad will Oden had to do that for 5 years
If it was really just too waste time Oda could've retconed the timing
The 5 year thing plays into Odens character
> No one is the owner of shusui, it should be burried with Ryuma <@185141276847505410>  The previous owner gave it to Zoro which makes it his rightfully
No
It was Brooks shadow, Ryumas body
The way he spoke wasn't Brook at all
He was straight up a samurai
He had his memories
What makes you you?
If you have your memories but also some of another person's personality who are you?
Nah he smiled cause he's Yasui D.
Lmao
Yeah but like even if he didn't have one he would've smiled
Trust ik everything
Yes but it also depends on the wielder
It doesn't equal power
At some point a strong person has higher output than their blade can hold
So they need a better one
Yeah Zoro
Zoro straight up breaks any weak sword and that's before he even got that strong
Is the top rank of swords only for black blades?
> <@521783526878609418>  > No since White Beard has a top tier blade <@185141276847505410>  Yeah that's where I was going
I think maybe it is a black blade and Oda just didn't draw it
I think the Wado gonna break in a clash with Mihawk when he wins
> <@521783526878609418> which sword? <@426750321893703683>  White Beard's bisento
Why wouldn't he draw haki in the entire first half of the show
What other supreme grade blades have we seen?
Were they not black?
Ok so hear me out
Yoru is black and Zoro was told he could upgrade Enma to supreme grade if he made it a black blade
I think to become a supreme blade it'd make sense if it had to be black
Well ig we gotta wait for Oda to explain it
I think it's dumb that white beards blade isn't black
Ok so the theories I've heard are the either you need strong haki to do it or need lots if time
White beard had both
We don't know for sure
Because before it was black it wasn't the tank before supreme grade
I can't think of a single reason why white beards blade shouldn't be black
He's had his bisento for half a century
He died rather young tho
Yeah but we know a swordsman can Turn his blade black
So why wouldn't whitebeard the literal strongest man be able to
> <@521783526878609418> maybe this wasn't confirmed but for a sword to be black it needs to be constantly imbued with haki which happens when one trains a lot or fights a lot which WB didn't do because he just wanted a family and not to be a pirate king >  > And black balde means the color just changes to black, the blade is not permanently imbued with haki because we saw zoro cut monet with shusi and she didn't die. <@426750321893703683>  The family thing is a good explanation but it's not like White beard was a pacifist and fought other crews all the time
I think that's a good explanation tho
Not always
Back in the day he didn't his crew was much smaller
He had his bisento since at least when he met Oden
And by then he was already infamous
The family thing is pretty much the only reason I can think of
He had the power if thats what it takes and he had the time if thats what it takes
Y'all know why there's aura now?
Because the new animater from dragon ball
As simple as that
No it doesn't
It's literally beautiful
Different = bad to you
Do you think the broly movie is bad?
Ugly doesn't = different bro stop being so close minded
How
Hey you know what's crazy?
Just don't watch the anime
What an animater who specializes in making things extravagant made the already existent aura even cooler? Woow
That's why he was hired bro
The Broly movie literally destroyed the box office in sales
We should be happy to have the animater from the movie
Not crying because it's different
He was put as the one piece head animator for a reason if u don't like it then don't watch homes
Except that's what they wanted
"we"
Don't speak for anyone but yourself
I mean it's literally the decision of the studio
He's acting like this man came up and shit on Odas work
Lol yeah that's what I'm doing
W
Thank u Doom
People from reddit don't like something?!?
CALL THE PRESSES
Reddit doesn't like something!
Lmao
Enjoy it or don't this decision was made to make the manga better
People were mad about the post time skip animation Change
People always mad about something changing
No it's not
It's an anime the art style is the animation, unless you meant the way the characters move as animation
Yeah if you're talking about the movement then it's better then ever
But he means the art style and that's what I was referring too as well
Don't watch it
Animators are artist
They don't make the art for people who don't like it
> Coc can change weather too <@376748967137902594>  Nah bro that's too much I hate it why would the animators do that
LMAO
Adam wood strong against shit like crashing it can't take a straight up yonko hit 💀
Hiyori crying somewhere
Jesus Christ Tanu
<:ZoroNut:632474447462400010>
Kaido fucks big mom in a double spread page
As a kid
I never stopped
Searching for a great treasure
One piece outro 1 is a masterpiece
I had a map in my mind That I knew would lead me I had to find my way to that place Before someone could beat me The promised land was in my grasp And I wouldn't let go
> Luffy Kidd and law fighting in the new op is sooo good <@564773067969265674>  It's good but have you heard ending 1?
I'm rewatching it on Netflix
And fuck ending 1 is amazing
Yeah loser
Loser race
I'm so disappointed that Marco with perosparo and not King
But also he isn't fighting Perosparo
What are they doing
Bruh are you caught up?
Oh lmao
I mean theyret with each other rn
Yeah that might be it but idk why pero would betray bigmom
Pero is literally bigmoms right hand
I highly doubt that he's going to betray her
He's not katakuri
Bro did you just say jutsu?
<#206841928019476491>  come on bro
😔😔😔😔
<#206841928019476491> don't let me catch you all here again
No
I think Elbaf will be a lil shorter than dressrosa
NARUTO?!?
<#206841928019476491>
Delete that message now 😈
Lmao
I think Elbaf will be fishman island arc
Length
Picoloco? <#206841928019476491>  stop bro
The way shanks is connected to Elbaf <:ZoroNut:632474447462400010>
Thanks actually the second prince of Elbaf bro can't you tell he's a giant
All his size went to cock tho
Nah > That's a reach bro <@698761447835959337>  Eric the red most famous Viking, Shank... The red?!?
I mean when you have a viking ship and have red as your main characteristic there is obviously some Viking shit going on
I'm not sure if Shanks is connected to it
But I mean there's a good amount of evidence to loosely connect to it
Do you mean Laughtale?
Lmao
Nah I was joking I call it Raftel
I won't stop calling it Raftale or Raftel
Every
Bro why don't they just skip the Wano war arc we already did the build up that's enough right?
> <@!536282939038892053> you mean the flashback <@319602380041879552>  Nah bro time travel
Luffy actually causes the Void century by traveling to the past
Damn one piece version of Boruto be like Void century again
Wait wtf
<#206841928019476491>
Come on bro
Bro Kaido just going to New kamaland in impel down leave him alone
Homie just wants to party
Lmao tbh the manga isn't canon because Oda's hands drew it not his mind
> One piece is one piece <@241848072328445952>  Nah
Nah anything besides Odas mind isn't canon sorry bro
If you talking about anything besides what's in odas head that isn't one piece and I expect you to go to <#206841928019476491>  RN 👿
Kaido been captured multiple times
Yeah if Orochi was still living I think he would've like, moved? Or, breathed?
If we could proof read it then we could read Japanese and wouldn't need Artur in the first place
Bro why don't people just read Japanese idiots
I listen to Tekking and Totally not mark
Yeah Tekking loves Artur
One piece has no villains bro
Just misunderstood heroes 😔
Who's tryna play a one piece dnd
Yeah Tekking does one peace dnd but the people he does it with are boring so I don't wtach it
Like literally no one has energy so it's just Tekking doing shit
Is that the guy with the accent? He's the only other entertaining one
> Knight <@258408841878831104>  Yeah he does the accent right?
I also only watched episode 1 when it came out
They mostly seemed like first time dnd players which isn't bad at all but it's hard to make a dnd show when you're learning to play and trying to be a personality
As they play I'm sure it gets funnier
But because I used to work so much I barely watched it
Nah Tekking has done a few campaigns and even started writing his own he's done a lot of research on it
It's hard to be new at something complicated like dnd and be a good personality at the same time I don't blame them at all
Nah when they started the one piece dnd he had already released a few dnd vids and talked about his own campaign
You could tell he was more focused on being funny than the game because he was used to it
I don't blame the people as DND ain't easy when first starting
Especially when you have to be a YouTube personality at the same time
