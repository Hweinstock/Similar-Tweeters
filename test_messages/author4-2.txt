LMAO
What happened
Is that what happens when you curse?
He said a bad word and insulted the mods
Rip
I'ma be honest tho people who are super uptight about which channel you send legit 2 messages in slightly off topic are so annoying
A quick tangent doesn't mean switching to a different channel bro
<:ZoroWeary:701983967041159169>
Idek who that was
Bro the poor editor we get it he overreacted let's not hang him for it
I didn't either
But like would you rather never have an editor say their opinion again for the sake of avoiding the community attacking them? Or a new editor overreacting a little bit one time?
Everyone attacking him is just gonna make it so legit no editor is gonna say their opinion ever again
Idk there's a difference between an opinion and spoiling
Chouchou a legend no cap
Damn not gonna lie
I do be missing katakuri rn
The dog
Chouchou literally has a better willl than Ussopp
Nah but I often think back to it when referring to certain racially fueled  current events of today
Yes
The savior
More than Ca- nvm
Lmao
Where the Chouchou emojis at wtf
Nah
King is in Uranus
Like what if Kings people specialize in Uranus
Not they're calways inside of and working on Urnaus
King must love Uranus
Yeah Kaido does have Uranus
He's strong enough to take Uranus when ever he wants
> wtf how did kaido get my anus <@703504844903940096>  Bro homie strong enough to take it
anyone who's not Odas brain isn't canon so idkkkk
Like the things Oda says aren't canon because it came from his mouth not brain
Damn imagine if Marcos flame could hurt people
Marco would be the most op man out here
Kinda like lion man
Golden boy Shiky
Wiki itself isn't canon
Not Odas brain
Until wiki can connect cybernetically to Oda brain nothing canon
Nah no canon movie yet
Best girl Yamato
Shiki sleaping bro
Idky they didn't put him on rocks crew
Yeah alright dummies
Yamato >>>>>
Shiki hibernating
He's trying to find his legs
W
All I do on Instagram is argue with dumb people
"Admirals are as strong as Yonko" Ok idiots time to debate
Discord
Imagine thinking an admiral could 1v1 a prime yonko 🤡
And win
Nah he's as high as one
Yeah prime garp
Kaido shits on current Garp
Pk level is weak bro wtf
How strong is a dead body?
Oh no here comes Rogers lifeless dead body boho hope he doesn't give me worms
Shanks is actually only 47 level seat 6 yonko commander Max
Y'all overestimated him bro
Luffy barely 8th supernova level
Ah yes Dragon the yonko
Shanks weak bro wdym
A sea serpent thing ate his arm
Garbage ass character
Literally anyone, I mean legit anyone! Remember that Marine that allowed Coby to join? Yeah even him. > shanks
Nah tbh me and Oda talked about this
SSG just making iPhones for the Marines
Snapchat time boys
Nah bro trust DF ain't shit when you for an iPhone
Kanjura still alive Oda doesn't off screen off a character we've had for literally about 7 years now
Nah I don't think he's dead, why would he be dumb enough to face all of the scabards by himself like that with no real back up?
He knows all of their power
That's still not backup
Kanjura isnt a normal character, his entire life has been about deceiving the scabards and learning everything about them, I highly doubt he would just decide to fight them head on without anything planned
He's been a major character for the past 7 years
Oda isn't gonna offscreen him
Shanks stops another war
Damn this is the first time since Marineford that mass deaths are gonna happen
Luffy said this was a war so ig it is
Nah
A lot of beast pirates and Samaria
I forgot the punk hazard gas
And who died in Dressrosa? people were just like knocked out and captured
Weren't people evacuated tho
Move away from it?
Huh how do you evacuate from anything bud?
Yeah but it was stopped
Yeah but it did stop the one time it was used in the story
Or kinda small
The tontadas could've gone through it
Punkhazard was a massacre
Does Buggy have haki?
Yeah that's death
But like war level mass death
The gas in punk hazard ricked da people
Blood
Blood is scarier
It's also based on a book that used blood
There was a sea of blood somewhere in there
Dragonman
No
> boiling blood is just boiling water <@703504844903940096>  Boiling blood would actually have less water than normal Blood
It would become thicker
> after 100 degrees the blood would just become vapour <@703504844903940096>  Yes but as you boil water you leave nothing, when you boil blood there's still the part of blood that isn't water left
Boiling blood is how some color pigment was made a long time ago
So the more you boil blood the thicker it will get
It's like boiling a stew
The more time you allow it to cook the less water it will have and the thicker it would get
Yeah because it's mostly water, the part of blood that boils is the water which turns into steam, the sodium iron and other parts in the blood don't turn into a gas at 100 degrees
Which would make the whole thing thicker the longer you boil it
It's the same idea as cooking something down
Yeah its just like stew
Sanji facts
I made a dumb joke about ssg calm down m8
I gotta go work out I'm out too
It's his will they're carrying on
If you think of ryou and Haki as just the will power of someone makes enough sense to me
If it's touched upon more than I could disagree with how it's dealt with but if it's just that 1 statement I think it's fair enough
Just drank 20 ounces of muscle water
Bruh moment
> since he has been captured BY mARINES BEFORE <@319602380041879552>  That would make sense but he was captured multiple times
So at least twice
But I'm assuming they would've just said twice
But also could've been when he was younger
Maybe the historians were just like flat earth conspiracy theorist and there's only 1 moon
Nah
How often we looking at the sky
> maybe that panel is representing old astrology believes when people thought everything revolves around earth <:BrookShrug:680559335058702376> <@690158729685106749>  I think this probably the best explanation I've ever heard tho that makes more sense than anything else
> notice the other body with a moon itself <@561641021268557825>  Moons with other smaller objects orbiting them not impossible
Maybe it was joke Stupid kid Robin's bad science project and they were all making fun of it
I mean I don't think there's multiple moons but,
There's more evidence to say there is than to say there isn't
No one has said "there's one moon"
We've also never saw a lot of things in one peace that doesn't mean it isn't real
Also there's planets with moons that each have different rotational cycles that are insanely different
I don't think there's multiple moons
But there's factually in one peace a diagram of what normally in science would be a planet and it's moons
0 no moons
I mean I'm not agreeing with anything I'm just saying until we know for sure we literally can't for sure say either way
> because that model is the classic geocentric model and usually refers to planets and not moons <@495255829369454612>  While I do like the idea of the histroians thinking in the geocentric mind space as an explanation of this it's a fact that the one piece world is way to technologically advanced to believe that
They literally blew up the model with giant guns from a giant warship
The eras and ideas wouldn't match up at all
Its technologically advanced enough for the literal most studied people in the world to know the earth isn't the center of the galaxy
I mean while yeah technology levels are different around the world that's because some islands have less contact with the outside world than others that's just factually incorrect for the scholar of Ohara who were famous around the world for being the smartest ever
All I'm saying is we cant 100% say either way
There's a model studied by the literal most advanced historians of the time that appears to support the multiple moon theory but then again we haven't seen the moons
> How do u know OP's planet isn't the center of the galaxy? <@415999229564157955>  Basic things like orbiting the sun probably are the same in the one piece world m8 if the earth was the center many things would be completely different
Ig but if you wanna say that none of our physics apply to one piece than literally everything we know of most of one piece would be different
The gravational force needed to literally everything would be different
The basics of what we know would be completely different
Yeah but if the force is the same then so should the things that affect the forces
Ig but my original point stands, we don't know for sure either way
There could couldn't be multiple moons
> Oda could literally say they've only had one moon because the other 5 orbit the other side of the planet at the time <@114296407816404992>  Yeah that's a fairly normal thing with some planets
Nah I disagree, unless we've shown specifically there's only one moon we can't stick with anything
We didn't see the grandline until they were there that doesn't mean it didn't exist
There's moons that take literall earth decades and centurys to orbit a planet
I feel like in a world with people who can kick the air to walk on it multiple moons isn't that crazy
> Not only have we only seen just one moon at the sky at any given time, it seems to be the same moon every time <@206896898215378945>  That's an odd claim?
How could we possibly tell the difference especially when the  art style has changed throughout time
There's a moon every 30 days
> Permanent daylight on Enies Lobby. Any opinions on that? <@251249266121506816>  LED lights under the water
Bluetooth probably too
Kizaru jerks off on enies loby daily
He says "let there be light"
There's multiple rn i think
Exactly
Lmao
Yeah makes sense
Again why would a people that are fairly technologically advanced believe that
If you tell me a tribe on some island thought that then sure
This is the Oharan scholars known across the world
People were Geocentric because of a lack of technology
That a group of people who have the technology of war ships and machine guns think they are geogentir?
In the real life pirate era people know the earth wasn't the center of the galaxy
In fact the geocentric era had completely ended more than a century prior
I don't think there's evidence to disprove the multiple moons but not enough to prove it either
Luffy saying this is a war is amazing
Yeah it's war time baby
Dressrosa is much better when you binge it than watch or read it weekly
Also direct correlation between Oden and Roger and Yamato and Luffy
Small lines Oda draws to compare Roger and Luffy
Fishman island a good solid arc
Idk no one but the red scabards have such an insanely strong reason and feeling toward kaido
Damn how could we all be so blind
The sheep guy who made the going Mary was a mink all along
> <@!521783526878609418> you mean Merry who designed Going Merry <:CarrotSmug:701664910865858580> <@319602380041879552>  Yeah
Momo gonna finish off Kaido no cap
Momo gonna turn into his adult form and go dragon and finish kaido
No
I think only the best minks are
The strongest I mean
Like I'm sure all the guardian ones can control sulong
Didn't work last time
Kaido still has the numerical advantage tho
A small time skip wouldn't be bad
After wano where the strawhats help fix things in wano a lil
Yes
Wait no
Nah I think the scaberds chilling
They finna help Momo rebuild after
Inu < neko       Dogs > Cats
W
Werewolf boy coming
Neko literally has an arm canon
He's so cool
Yeah on his leg not as cool
Neku way better but in real life dogs are better
Lmao
Inu isn't better
He literally Garbo
Even Carrot has more personality than Inu
Yes I always prefer sexual predators over cool loyal swordsmen
Lasagna indeed
Nah Neko the exception
Also nekos weapon cooler too
W
Got em
Stop
Loser
Bruh what
Merry sulong
Merry a mink
Y
LMAO
All minks can go sulong but only some can control it
Bepo solung makes him want to cuddle people
I can't see u
Bepo went let's go exploring
You can't say dick bro wtf 👿
Imwhag is bounce house?
<:LawWut:586269499494498334>
Ah awakening Luffy
Neko so cool
I love his weapon
Polearms just cool
Glaives from kingdom
Just finished lifting I can no longer move W
Breaks are always strategically at the worst times
I've already drinking a lil over a gallon today I'ma just sleep
I fasted today too aside from protein shake and bar
Damn that's tuff
I've been in 4 car accidents so anything involving my back is harder
I gotta do insanely more stretches than normal people
And I would love a role how do I get one?
Yeah
He used armorment against bigmom
Did I do it?
How do I know if I have a role?
W
For the sake of being a yonko commander I just hope Ace had basic Haki
Sbs I think
At least CoC was
COC is confirmed but as a yonko commander I like to head cannon that he has all 3
That's a good point but Smoker could've just pulled an Aoikiji and just move his body around the haki punch
Sabo the coolest
<:SaboEvil:705903442995970058>
Yeah ight
I think my only resentment with Sabo is his bounty
Bruh Mud man
Sabo didn't even come back he was just introduced lmao he wasn't mentioned at all till later
Oda didn't think of Sabo at first
At least I don't think he did
Nah I'm just saying Sabo wasn't mentioned at all in the first half of the show
> lol, people really expecting Oda to have planned EVERY single detail of the story since the beginning <@474659436804177930>  Lmao I don't but I was just saying Sabo is one of those things he didn't plan at first
Obviously no big manga was expected to go as long as they went
Oda is great to tieng in no things into old things
Nah I don't think so
Yeah Totally not mark still thinks they blood brothers
I genuinely can't remember watching everything for the first time so idek what I was thinking back then
Yeah that's the difference
Rubber has more resistance than mochi does
I think the only reason Kat wouldn't be able to do gear like things is like you said his body is made out of mochi its not it's properties so it doesn't like have resistance against itself if that makes sense
Damn my ex was named Kat now we sad mode
Oda went nah bro logia? Nah Special Paramecia
As Eminem once said "I got your name tattod on me twice now fuck now my new girl has to be named Kim"
Time out I'm watching Tekkings review
And why is Hawkins with Law wtf
It really does look like it
> hawkins is with law when? <@735836669445537863>  I'm not 100% sure it's him but someone standing next to law in the last chapter and from behind he looks exactly like Hawkins
Look at the law scene in the last chapter
We don't know for sure if it is but if it is dam that's a good ally to have
Thanks Margaret
Yeah there's a big chance it isn't
But if it is epic
Lmao
Berserk is good but read Kingdom
Berserk is a nother good fight manga but kingdom is something very different
Sorry if this isn't <#206841928019476491> just stating my kingdom opinion
Kingdom fills an itch of strategy and politics that I love that One piece whole amazing doesn't really have
Douglas Bullet who?
Damn I wonder when we'll get a new movie
> mfw I realize mark's probably read ace's death by now<:Crydo:586275183032270849> <@491390898031296532>  From a comment he made i think he was spoiled on it tbh
Ah that's cool the 1 year anniversary was literally a few days ago
Yeah I'm really worried someone spoiled the ace death for him but he literally said "I hope no one dies, or do they?!?!?" And a pic of ace appears
So idk tbh
Idk Bigmoms back story wasn't rocks related
Im just as hungry for rocks as everyone else tho
And it looks like Kaido was young while in rocks crew so probably more important in his life
<:ZoroWeary:701983967041159169>
Damn people really think Garp the current strongest marine still by a lot
Blew my mind tbh
Even if he is there's no way it's by a lot
I agree
<:AkainuSweat:586408945137090571>
Akainu when he sees garp
I have a headache from fasting so I'ma sleep it off GN boys
> <:LuffyAaaaahhhh:230860377745915905> <:aFeelsAceMan:586371608382537759> <:AkainuSweat:586408945137090571> <:WBDisgust:650047749831524372> <@212265078739828737>  LMAO
LMAO nah Im not like ill or anything
I just plan on intaking a lot of calories tomorrow so I'm lowering my calorie intake today
Just maths
😎
Yeah I used to do it a lot
I haven't fasted in like a year tho
Tomorrow is my rest day from working out so for the first time in like a month I'm gonna eat fast food breakfast
Deficit
Yeah gaining muscle mainly
Nah I'm not like on a high deficit
I'm still on a deficit but mostly just changing the calories I intake
I'm mostly on protein and Bock choy
Because bok choy is the god of vegetables
I also drink a gallon of water a day
Lmao I'm actually a chef so we out
Not to flex but I worked at the #1 restaurant in Miami before Covid
It's called La Mar by Gaston Acurio
I couldn't even afford to eat there 😔
High end we change the menus pretty frequently
A few fixed items but seasonal mostly
Eh you get used to it
My job has gotten me closer to my goals in life I got really lucky tbh
Through my job I got to meet, hang out with, cook for, and coook with the current and previous #1 chef in the world
Covid kinda fucked my industry so I gotta join the Navy for a few years to get the good good benefits
Lmao I get you I've literally been driving since October and I've been in 4 car accidents
Mostly cause I worked close to and sometimes over 50 hours a week while being a full-time highschool student while taking care of my grandpa
So like I was out of it during that time most of the time when I wasn't working
Covid revived me lmao
Yeah lol we all chill now tho I graduated and my grandpa got better
Japanese people are xenophobic
Sometimes lol
All people have goods and bass to them tbh
Japan straight up the most Xenophobic country probably
Also has a failing economy which is sad
The Olympics would've saved itb
It*
But then covid said nah
Literally in 2 decades if Japan doesn't change economy gone
You're 100% correct the economy is getting worse because the status of living is so high
As the status of living increases, the population triangle shifts, rn Japan's population triangle is literally upside down
They have wayyyyy more old people than they do kids
Their population can't support the economy, the Olympics was supposed to bring in foreign workers
Japan can't sustain itself in a few decades without the help of foreign labor but it's also really hard to go work in Japan because of the lasting effects of xenophobia
Japan's problem is bad and good at the same time
They wouldn't have the problem in the first place if the country wasn't as xenophobic in the first place
Just like if Wano was opened by Oden dad back then this probably wouldn't be happening in Wano
Nah I'm saying if it was
Nah the WG would be more involved
Well also I'm not Oda so idk
But in real life, if Japan wasn't as close minded and xenophobic in the past it wouldn't be upside-down triangle now
To die
He wants death
Yeah
Oohh the Yamato thing cool
Where's Coby I love him so much
I miss him
Coby best marine
Coby then smoker
Yes
But he still thinks the good out weighs all the bad
Maybe he's right
Targeted CoC 100% a thing
I'm back boys
And legit Luffy using it at Marineford, he targeted it mostly at the executioners and not just everyone around him
> Luffy couldn’t target it at marineford <@372464153480134666>  Nah he saw Ace about to die so not even only him tho lmao Whitebeard tried using conquers Haki on the executioners but failed because of his sickness, then Luffy uses it knocking out the executioners but not just a bunch of Marines in the huge circle
Yeah for sure but if he could control it he would've just knocked out the Executioners
I mean that's why he used it in the first place tho
The executioners were about to kill Ace
What?
Oh yeah he didn't use it on purpose
Whitebeard also tried using his COC to stop them but failed
White beard was really far away
With a bullet to the head
No prisoners
Yes 😈
> sea prism wont work on them <@460418344584085514>  Lmao well I mean sea prism may not weaksn normal people but it's still super durable and unbreakable so if the person is super strong you'd still probably use it
Yeah
Yeah even for a non df user it's still literally impossible to escape
No
But does seastone completely cancel out a devil fruit?
Like is Luffy no longer rubbery when tuchjnf seastone?
Seastone just weakens them it doesn't turn of their df right?
So if ace is in contact with it in just his hands his entire body is enable to use his fruit at all?
Yeah it does
Nah you can still use your fruit in water
Yeah but I think Luffy could still stretch in seaprism cuffs
Damn I brought this up because it would be cool for law to be able to create a room and cut seaprism in it just like how he cuts people in half and shit
Alright let's settle how Buggy's fruit works
I think the only reason Mihawk didn't cut him wasn't because Buggy is immune to Haki it's because Buggy was splitting his body right before the cuts touched him
Buggy being immune to haki literally breaks the rules that are set into place in the story
I mean he was straight up on the pirate kings crew he isn't just a normal pirate
> Mihawk *couldn't* cut him. It's not that he didn't. He is immune to cuts. <@171861037438599169>  If he used Haki I think he could've
> He is immune to cuts. <@171861037438599169>  Luffy is immune to punches and bullets, until haki is involved
Dam it's over now
Doom going angry mode
I mean tbh I don't remember every detail of every arc ESPECIALLY Dressrosa lmao
Any fruit that you can't use on your own is literally worse fruit
Why didn't he just have a pet dog
But like
A big one
> the good old "if it's not able to use it in 1on1 honorable combat, it's bad" fruit <@160778857702490113>  Nah not what I mean, but if he doesn't have his brother around what is he gonna do?
My point was if you have to rely on someone else for your fruit to work it's a bad fruit
How easy is it for him to forcefully make someone wear him?
What?
> so belo betty's fruit is bad? <@171861037438599169>  This was a terrible example and bad analogy
Yes but the difference is she isn't using her fruit to fight herself
The jacket guy is
Doom mad because people don't like jacket man grree
Why people no like jacket man?!?
I read manga jacket man good!!!!
Alright my bad let me rephrase
If your fruit is about YOU fighting, then it's dumb for it to have to rely on others to work.
Because Belo Betty isn't a fighter
Jacket man is a fighter
> I re read that chapter and if bobby didnt want to wear kelly theres no way kelly could have forced it <@703504844903940096>  Imagine a jacket trying to make u wear it?
What are u gonna do?!? 😢😢😢😢
Not wear it? No impossible
Guys I can see.... a jacket in my closet!! Someone come help!!!!
And then fighting
Bro it's literally about you fighting
Homie wearing boxing gloves at all times
You right he a politician
Very head cannon of you to assume he has other moves
Choc I'ma be honest man it's a shit fruit, how forceful could you be to force a jacket onto someone?
🚓🚓🚓🚓🚓
Sorry Choc had to do it you FBI read that message on their way to your house
There's so many things to debate in the one piece world
And we talking about if a jacket can forcefully make someone wear it
LMAO
Be had to put his sleeves on himself
He tries to control a wolf
But instead just dies
W
A wolf wouldn't let a jacket be forced on u
Source: Logic
Choc let me try forcing a jacket on u
Y'all remember that one episode of Jimmy neutron where all the pants attacked the city?
> <@!521783526878609418> **you think he'll use the same tactic for a wolf that he uses when working as a team with his brother?** <@160778857702490113>  It doesn't matter what tactic hell use on a wild HE'S A FUCKING JACKET
Moving = forcing a jacket onto a wolf?
> a jacket that can force other things to wear it , how is this so hard to understand when its litteraly mentioned in the manga <@198930928083402753>  Let me read where it says "force" in the manga
Head cannon boys
Moving doesn't equal forcing a wild animal to wear you
Bro actually wait I can move! Can I forcefully wrap myself around a full grown wolf by myself?
> it's headcanon to assume that he just has to lie down and wait for something to wear him <@160778857702490113>  No it's fact that from what we've seen someone puts him on
Yeah you right my bad
But not because any moving creature can
I'm just built different
But then he'd be controlling a beat up wolf 🥺

I want you all to go get a jacket rn and attempt to force a human on the streets to wear it
Until then we won't assume he can just force himself onto anything
Yeah but you're sentient aren't you?
Try forcing a peace of clothing on any human
Especially one stronger than you
Lmao
Good luck bro
Ah yes the science of forcing clothing on others
> scientfically speaking you can do it <@198930928083402753>  My favorite science
Moving = Forcefully making yourself worn by someone else
Great
Doom when someone doesn't agree with him: You just think what everyone else thinks grrrrrr I'm different
Gaben go rn with a jacket to someone STRONGER than you and force someone to put it on
Please record it
Then I'll be proven wrong
When you guys can prove that a sentient jacket can make another person wear it with facts I'll say your right
Until then 🤷‍♂️
Then die bro
No one forcing you to read this tbh
It's as simple as closing discord or leaving this foruo
Why because I'm not gonna believe something because you just say so?
Guys jacket can force humans to wear it! How? Yes
Gaben send the manga
Because you're brain dead bro
Literally never said anything about forcing others
Gaben making new manga pages up guys Gaben is Oda omg
Gaben please if you're just gonna repeat it's there it's there I swear without it being there then don't talk because at least Doom has an actual argument
Enrobe doesn't mean the word force
Guys I think I know everything so I take the manga and say it means X because ik stuff
Imagine arguing over something that you interpreted as true
Doom are u serious? Have you read anything people have been saying to me? Legit Gabet just says brain dead brain dead over and over to prove his point
I mean idc but like at least read
Lmao
Yeah after saying they want to die because they read my messages
I don't insult people unprovocated bud
At the end of the this is a manga legit just a leave of entertainment and art people insulting each other over OUR interpretation of it is genuinely dumb
Oh shit my bad
This is like American politics
But instead of jacket df they talk about the constitution lmao
On God doom I was enjoying myself arguing with u but when people literally just start going Alex you're so fucking dumb and stupid hahaha it's pretty annoying
And idrc but it turns the argument into something much more sour
Neko gonna go sicko mode
Lmao
Piccolo actually rules up and says nah and blows up the moon
Because he's the GOAT
Yes
<:ZoroNut:632474447462400010>

Alice in wonderland type vibes
Neko gonna eat some ass
Kaido ass
> some are expecting diffrent sulongs to have diffrent elements tho idk bout it <@198930928083402753>  Like besides electric?
I mean just because he does have Alice in wonderland vibes the cat from that do have teleportation powers
Maybe he'll be moving so fast that it's gonna look like teleportation
White when the bigmom lion went sulomg did he turn white?
Yeah pekoms my bad
I'm bad with names
All white makes sense because if the snow
Yo wait time out
I never watched all of wci just read it, did Pekoms go crazy mode and do cool shit all around the town in the manga? Cause in the anime homie going crazy
Legit I only remember him being held down and shit in the manga
Am I having memory loss
In the anime pekoms legit a super hero
It's queen
Abandoned? LMAO FAT L BRO
That'd be sick
I hope Neko joins while Inu take care of all of Zou
Do you guys consider every strong character who uses a sword a swordsmen?
> Shanks is stronger, Mihawk <@283276421470748673>  You read my mind lol
I think it comes down to shanks not considering himself a "swordsman"
Yeah
Oh lmao
Nah no way bro
Shanks weakest yonko Luffy strongest 5th yonko
> <@!460418344584085514> shanks stronger than mihawk sorry* <@651757948061745162>  Oh yeah I think so tbh
Idk if Mihawk has CoC
> imo you call someone a swordsman as long ass > 1. calls himself a swordsman with pride > 2. mainly uses a sword <@445046828824789002>  Yeah I agree shanks isn't a "swordsman" even tho he uses a sword
Also the home boy Gol D Roger used a sword
But he isn't a "swordsman"
> why isn't he a swordsman <@445046828824789002>  It comes down to the person's mind set at the end of the day I think
Ooo that's a way better question tho
Not who's stronger but who has more sword skill
Mohawk in sword skill tbh
<:ShanksHmmm:586437070742880257>
True
I don't think shanks would ever "scars on the back are a swordsmens shame"
Idk I don't really hate anyone in one piece tbh
I hate sabos bounty and that's about it
I think Flampee should be hated tho so I think that's a lil different
Oda wanted us to not like Flampee
> <@521783526878609418> why? <@606196171307745308>  Drgaon is the most wanted but his second in command has a very small bounty
I'm there's reasons to excuse this
But it'd just make more sense if it was higher in the first place
Like I get why it might be so low
But like 2nd in command of the literal enemy of the WG
Yeah after the reverie if he isn't captured or something it'll increase
Sengoku an under rated character
I mean he's done a lot, but you can always just say he did it without getting caught
And that's fine I don't mind that reasoning it's still probably one of the only things in one piece that bugs me a lil
Also waiting for the day when Shanks says he didn't have to lose his arm 😔
> We still might get a reasoning from Oda, it only got confirmed in an SBS <@283276421470748673>  Yeah for sure
Luffy goes "but shanks, you were strong enough back then to defeat him with just your conquers haki" Shanks replys "But Oda didn't know that in chapter 1"
I read redtaro as retardo lmao
Shanks is a showmen
He put on a good show then when he got on the ship him and the boys laugh "did you see luffys face when I lost my arm?!? LMAO"
What an idiot that kid
We decided it was best to move on
<:ZoroWeary:701983967041159169>
Jacket ban
Lmao
I wonder if his prev captain actually made it hmmmm
Yeah BB pain thing is kinda wear
Even if BB doesn't have multiple personalities he genuinely has some form of mental illness probably
The never sleeping thing kinda weird
LMAO
But he didn't even steal the bread they got the wrong guy
Bruh your cousin could destroy the world
That's where rocks is
LMAO
Like a theory almost
My headcanon fires COLA
Bro I just realized yesterday how much stuff At&t owns like wtf
They own all of Warner Bros, all of HBO, a big part of YouTube channels as they own a company that does nothing but does like partnership type things with channels, and much more
Warner Bros alone is huge
They own so much shit themselves
At&t way bigger than I thought
My bad just a At&t tangent
<:ShanksHmmm:586437070742880257>
Shanks a deby downer tbh
Why'd he stop the war?
Pussy
<:CobyCry:700488898610069565>
What a lil baby thing to do
> perospero was sitting on a candy slug in the middle of the ocean, he'd have no chance against marco who has instant regeneration and flight.  >  > It was probably Marco who prompted the temporary alliance <@348594551797317642>  Yeah I agree
If only the golden boy katakuri was there
Alliance is a strong word
More like diverge reinforcements
Perespero did not want an alliance so Marco tells him no reason for bigmom pirates to die here too bigmom will survive just don't send in any troops
The yonko saga would be very different
And BB would've escaped
During the Kaido crazyness
And I boil pasta doesn't mean I'm not scared of pasta
That's doesn't make much sense
But you know 🤷‍♂️
Wtf
Wievil would be a great Goalie
Same with Jouzu
Yup
Jozou for Goalie I mean
Damn tbh that'd be really cool to see
Like the ramen commercials they did
What if they did the one piece world for Olympic commercials
That'd be sooo cool
Mihawk and Zoro fencing
Sanji running
Luffy doing something lmao
Olympic one piece would be great
Well I mean shooting is also an Olympic sport lmao
Like literally ski shooting with a rifle also a sport
Swimming
Reyleigh going ham
Sanji behind him
Well it should've been this year lmao
Not to get back into how the lack of the Olympics will ruin Japan's economy again
But yeah they want it to be next year
But some people think it's not
Luffy was one too actually
It was all the major characters
Luffy Goku and Naruto were the main 3 but Sailor moon and a few others are ambassadors too
Yeah Luffy on the Olympic cover with them all
Yeah in American news report they only said Goku 💀 but if you look at the thing a bunch of famous animes are ambassadors
Yeah in all of the Olympics promotion it has everyone on it
This is official


Yokai watch I think
Astro boy
Sailor moon
Can't remember the lil kid
And idk the last two girls
But yeah Goku isn't really the main one but American reporters pretty much only known him and maybe Naruto so they said Goku in their articles
Brook a ref lol
Yeah you right
LMAO
Poor Coby
Wait
So like it's cannon that Sanji is strong enough to kick something around the entire radius of the earh
Which means Zoro is at least that strength
So Zoro can just cut the earth in half
Naruto fans SHAKING RN
One piece has planet busters easy
Uh if you're gonna watch the movie watch the filler too
The movie is good as hell tho tbh
I like all the post time skip movies wayyy more than the pre time skip ones
It's like more mystical I guess
Not all of them there's one filler that is important
G 8
No only G8
Everything besides G8 isn't important
Lmao yeah
Ah my child
G8? A legend
Beyond time and space itself
Even 7 generations from now G8 will still be whispered about
You past it already
It was way before the time skip
Thank u Tanu I didn't feel like googling it lmao
U a legend
I can't think of any good filler besides in DBZ
Driving episode
Baseball episode
DBZ filler are just slice of life animes with Gods
Fake? Nah bro piccolo just hate the dragon fruit and been hiding the whole time
Yeah it's fake
But I mean the enel if funny
I mean it's fake so it's more of a meme than a spoiler
I wouldn't say important to the story as much as just important to one piece and anime history
Making a filler arc that actually fits in with a series is really hard that's why people don't like filler
But G8 did it
It managed to break the norm set by animation at large
Yeah it does play into the story with the merry bit but still it's an amazing arc and tbh better than most one piece movies and some arcs
I mean literally wat better than the Davy back arc
Yeah like its normal for fillers to be bad like that's just to be expected when you take a story and just randomly add stuff to it
But then G8 actually does something amazing
I think the manga is better in pretty much every way except G8 and maybe the animation now in Wano
I also don't watch the wano anime I'm gonna watch it soon but there's really no reason to rush lol
It's the glasses
And the smoke
And the smile
Yeah blond vs white
Smoker is relatively young to the point he's a good rival to Luffy
But he just seemed older since logtown
Especially because Luffy couldn't even touch him
We need more antogonist that aren't just fighters but use strategy to defeat the strawhats like in G8
I thought that would be Orochi but he's just a poopoo head
Nah they manage to escape but the captain of G8 was like one of the few good Navy guys but he wasn't a fighter he was a thinker
He like played chess and used strategy against the Strawhats

Saw this on Instagram is epic
Dodging in place was an insane advantage becauss even if they have Haki it doesn't matter
I mean I think a factor you're ignoring here is techniques if Luffy just spammed gum gum pistol even if he had the same haki and speed as Kat he'd lose
> I think it’s safe to say that it’s about the full package not just individual things <@564773067969265674>  Yeah for sure if not then Luffy would be dead lmao
Pirates were also pretty democratic in real life voting in their captains and shared much more treasure between the crew than legal privateers did
Yeah
Mip at one point in history 50% of the population of the Western world were pirates
Lmao
The jacket does not divide this chat
I mean it's not your fault it's stereotypea
But realistically Pirates were people who were poor
Yeah they were just people who were poor and couldn't survive under legal means like being a privateer so they just joined pirate crews
I mean Im sure some were bad don't get me wrong they did break the law
But factually if you were a normal crew member of a pirate crew your captain would get maybe 2-3× more than you but if you were on a privateer ship the captain would take usually 10-14× more than you
Legal Privateer captains were literally rich and become Lord's and lands owners because of their privateering
I mean it was just legally how it worked back then
So many turned to pirates as it was more fair
Think illegal unions vs legal super oppressive capitalistic business owners
Throughout most of history it's rigged to be easier for the rich and people on top
Not all pirates were good and all of them were criminals
But they were criminals that believed in some basic equality between people
They committed crimes because if they didn't they would've died
Wait really?
I've never even heard of cover art theories this sounds so dumb
Franky if he was a shiny Pokemon
Wait what's the ace death one that sounds interesting
I'd say ace dying is probably one of the if not the biggest event in one piece so far
LMAO bruh
Tbh that just seems a lil too far of a stretch to me
Yeah I just meant for the manga itself
The stress of trying to save ace was real
Yeah his art style changed after the time skip
Ig
I don't like White beard
I love him 😔

Wdym Luffy a genius evidence that gif
Yeah he started getting the captain mentality back in water 7
Mythical zoans can translate to base at least in some form
Idk everyone want a piece of Orochi
A Momo kill would be good
Momo going into a crazed state and killing orochi over and over
Tbh disregarding my feelings for both Orochi and Kanjuro as characters, I genuinely think Oda isn't the type of writer to kill a character we've known and been with for literally 7ish years
Off screen*
Kanjuro has too much behind him to just die off screen in my opinion
Raizo deserves to die tbh
Life for life
All the minks death
Yeah probably
There's two of em so I think one will die
